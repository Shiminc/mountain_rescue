# mountain_rescue

This is a toy project of mine to practice several programming skills and engage in various visualisation design to understand the best strategy for different scenarios. Some analyses may not be exactly suitable to this data, but they are just for practicing purposes. 

It is still work-in-progress so could be messy. There are different modules in the `scripts` directory corresponding to various skills I am practicing.
1. `llm` - accessing an API of a LLM and using it to help identify information from text about mountain rescue incidents.
2. `scraping` - scraping a website - Wasdale Mountain Rescue https://www.wmrt.org.uk/, only publicly available content (Incident reports) is scraped.
3. `plotting` - various kinds of plots are designed to both explore the data as well as to achieve the goal of making a data journalism piece. Those in jupyter notebook are messy and await to be tidied up
4. `timeseries` - statistical modelling and plotting (arima, sarima, decomposition) of timeseries
5. `network` - using the graph theory to visualise the relationship of weather conditions in each mountain rescue incident.
6. `miscellenous` - various other explorations, including NLP etc. 
7. `utils` - utilities functions created to be used in other modules
