He had set out the previous afternoon to climb on Buckbarrow. The informant was contacted at their home and more details were gained. The missing climber had left details of exactly which route he was going to climb and we had details of the vehicle he was driving.The climber was using a rope technique whereby he led, then tied off, descended to untie the lower belay, then work his way back up. With all the information available, the team leader called the full team out at 0100 hrs. Shortly after this, the informant called the team leader to say the missing climber had turned up. He had called in somewhere else before going home. The recall went out at 0115 hrs.Postscript – one of our team members who lives close to Buckbarrow, was talking to Sir Chris Bonnington that afternoon on Buckbarrow and did notice the young man making his way up to the crags. Sir Chris had remarked on the quality of the Buckbarrow routes and that the climbing he had been doing on Santa Fe that day was very good and quite challenging.

Originally a group of 7, they had split up having left the summit of Scafell Pike at around 1900 hrs. Four of them had made it back to Brackenclose by 2030 hrs. but three were still overdue. He was advised that they were two men (aged around 30) and one woman (aged around 25) and that they were poorly equipped – shorts, day sacs, no torches, therefore not really up to spending the night out, given the weather – cold, windy and wet weather, with low cloud and poor visibility.Although the team does not provide a free guiding service, the team leader had the feeling that we would probably have to go for them. He set 2300 hrs. as a further time to review the incident and one of the team members went down to Brackenclose to see if he could spot any sign of them descending Brown Tongue.The team member rang again, from his mobile phone at Brackenclose at 2315 hrs., to say he had spoken to one and that the other two would be close behind.

He did ring Mill Forge as the Team Leader was opening the base and gave details which lead us to request a helicopter. The casualty had in fact fallen from below D Gully Buttress on Pike’s Crag and had fallen around a 30 meters tumble fall, sustaining head, chest, leg and arm injuries. He had been intending to do a rock climb on the crag but had apparently slipped just as he and his companion had reached the base of the crag.In total 16 members of the team responded. One of the team’s Deputy Leaders was in the vicinity of the accident when it happened and was on scene with radio communications within a few minutes. Three of the advance group were lifted and winched onto the scene by Navy Helicopter (but not before the advance had climbed to the top of Brown Tongue). Everybody else had to walk and most didn’t get to the scene before the rescue was completed. The team treated the casualty and got him ready on a stretcher, for winching to the helicopter. He was then evacuated by air to Whitehaven Hospital accompanied by one of the team doctors. The casualty was a male in his late 40’s from Ulverston.

Two people (22yr old and 56 yr old males – lightly equipped, no torches or whistles had rung 999 to say they were lost (not injured) and needed MRT assistance to help them down. Initially, we could not call them back as their mobile number was unavailable (a common experience). At about 2015 hrs we did talk directly to them and determined that they had been onto Scafell Pike but were now trying to return to Langdale. They described going down onto Great Moss and traversing over to the Green Hole area and Crinkle Crags. From various features, we guessed they were only a few hundred metres south of ‘Three Tarns’. We therefore got them to continue northwards until they could pick up the path again and to descend to Langdale. As no one else was expecting them in Langdale (they were camping for the night) we also rang the team Leader of Langdale / Ambleside MRT to advise him what was going on, giving him details of their vehicle and where it was parked.

They had received a 999 call from someone with a mobile phone, who reported hearing shouts for help and knew that someone else required Mountain Rescue assistance. They knew the location was at Mickledore ridge, between Scafell and Scafell Pike but phone reception had been cut at that point. Although the nature of the incident was at that time unknown, given the proximity of the accident black spot of Broad Stand, the team leader decided to do a full Team call out immediately. We were able to leave our Base at Gosforth with an advance group of members within 20 minutes of the initial call By then, we also got further information through the Police having managed to re-contact the informant – we now knew that someone had broken both legs and an arm and that he was bleeding. The location given appeared to indicate that this was indeed another Broad Stand incident and the assistance of a helicopter was therefore called for. Twenty members (including two team doctors) of Wasdale Mountain Rescue Team responded to the call. We treated a man (in his thirties and from London) who had indeed fallen around 20m from Broad Stand, Scafell, sustaining severe injuries to his feet and also breaking his right arm. He had been walking alone when the accident happened and had been lying injured for about half an hour before his shouts for help had luckily been heard by other passing walkers. Because of strong winds and difficult flying conditions at the scene, we had to carry the injured man to the nearest point the helicopter could land on. This was about a kilometre away but around 200m up hill ! The helicopter, from RAF Boulmer transferred him to West Cumberland Hospital and the Team returned to base by about 1730 hrs.

He had been found in the Green Hole area (upper Esk) by a group of walkers. They had taken four hours to get him off the hill and back to the farm at Brotherilkeld, Eskdale but there was concern about whether his wife might also be on the hill. The Team Leader accompanied by another team member responded, immediately taking our AED (Automatic External Defibrillator) up to Eskdale, to (a) offer potentially life saving equipment and (b) to talk to the group of walkers, in the hope of establishing where the casualty had been found and whether his wife might need searching for. We also called one of the team doctors (A&E Consultant and WMRT Deputy Leader) and he attended as well. (A County Ambulance was already on it’s way but due to the remote location at the head of the valley, the Team’s response is quicker). On examining the casualty, it became apparent that his chest pain was more likely to have been caused by impact from a fall. He had bumped his head and had shredded gloves and what was left of broken glasses in his pocket. The most likely explanation for his confused condition was that he had suffered a head injury, resulting from a fall. He was therefore admitted to WCH (and was discharged on the Sunday afternoon). His wife was located at the Stickle Barn, Langdale and no further Team response was required. ", Incident started at 17:10. ,17:10,,,,,,,

The intention being to deal with the first incident before diverting attention to the second problem. About 18 Wasdale MRT members and 10 Millom FSRT members attended and started carrying out search routes on the mountain. The fell parties were carrying enough equipment to cope with the two casualties when they were found. The Wasdale members took additional ropes and climbing gear for the second incident. This would allow them to deal with the group of missing climbers depending on how the situation developed on the hill. 5 search dogs and handlers joined the search for the injured walkers doing various routes from Wasdale, Eskdale and Keswick.

The team leader spoke to the lost party on the mobile and was advised that they were a group of four adults, reasonably well equipped but lost, having been on the summit of Scafell. They had been attempting to descend to Burnmoor Tarn with a final destination of Wasdale Head. They thought they were somewhere on Eskdale Fell. Their Global Satellite Positioning System (GPS) was ""playing up"" (but subsequently turned out to be wrongly pre-set). They were prepared to continue walking if given some guidance. They were asked to walk north until they could find and follow a good feature – Oliver Gill. That should have brought them down to a level where they could see Burnmoor Tarn and find their own way off the mountain. However, 15 minutes later, they rang back to say that their way was barred by a large crag. This information suggested that they were about two kilometres further north than they thought and that they were in fact at the top of Rake End Crags, a different part of Scafell. The team leader suggested they keep moving but in a different direction. However, due to the uncertainty of their navigation, they preferred to sit where they were and wait for the team.

The informant was at Wasdale Head. The man (from the North East) had last been seen near the summit at about 1535 hrs. when he became separated from his colleague. He did not have a map with him and we were given information about his previous medical history which gave us cause for concern. With incident 48 below, we now had two incidents on the go.

They had received a 999 call from two lads (18 and 19 yr old) who reported being stuck on steep ground on the West side of Yewbarrow. When the Team Leader eventually managed to get in touch with them (by mobile phone) they gave me what appeared to be a map reference (from their GPS) but in a format which was new to the team – i.e.: North, 54 degrees, West, 3 degrees etc. They also described where they had left their car and what route they had taken and told me what lakes etc they could see from their location. The team leader believed they were on the side of Yewbarrow and given that there is no easy way off, that doesn’t involve going down craggy ground, he thought it best to ask a small group of team members to go and assist them. He therefore did a committee group alert and 11 members attended (4 on the base/radio relays and 7 on the hill) Fortunately one of the team members managed to interpret their map reference and determined that they might actually be on the side of Lingmel – a different mountain! Further telephone conversations managed to glean enough information to suggest they were on the side of Kirkfell, yet another different mountain !! We finally managed to sight them not far down from the summit of Kirkfell and got to them at about 8.30pm. They were simply frightened to continue without assistance and were on steep loose scree. We put them in helmets and harnesses and assisted them to walk down. Very slow going, with us getting back to Wasdale Head at 10.30pm. The moral of the story : we are seeing an increasing trend that when people use their mobile phones to summon assistance, a lot of them don’t actually know where they are! We can cope better if those people admit to being lost, rather than give us what appears to confident information on their location, only for us to find that they’re on a different mountain.

Weather at the scene was cold, windy and extremely wet, and they were in thick cloud. There were a total of seven adults at the casualty site and a further seven members from the group were descending towards Wasdale Head. We found the group near the top of Piers Ghyll and worked on re-warming the casualty for about an hour, before carrying him on a stretcher down to a point on Lingmel Nose, where an RAF helicopter could get in to lift him to safety. He was flown to West Cumberland Hospital, where he made a full recovery. (Although he did make a quick recovery, he had been unresponsive prior to the Team arriving and had got so cold that he’d stopped shivering – i.e.: a sign that his body core temperature was below 30 degrees C. He certainly required assistance !!) As well as being warmed, he was treated with oxygen and his condition was monitored with the Propac. We also had a portable Automatic External Defibrillator with us, just in case he’d gone into Ventricular Fibulation. Due to the high winds, rain and low cloud, the helicopter had some difficulty getting near the casualty’s location (at Piers Gill). They were only able to get in to the pick up point during a break in the clouds and had to get him on board as quickly as possible. One of our team members twisted his ankle on the way down and we did think we might have to also carry him off. However, to all our relief, he managed to walk down under his own steam.

One member in particular was reported to be very experienced but one member of the group had not been feeling well, probably not fully recovered from doing Ben Nevis. They had waterproof clothing with them, torches, map and compass and a rope and even had a radio, although no contact could be made. The Wasdale Team Leader decided to wait until 2300 hrs before asking Search Dogs etc to go and look for them and expected that they had simply made a navigational error, probably going down on the Eskdale side of the fell. (Logic that a group of four could split up if one had suffered incapacity for some reason. Also that hundreds of people were already searching the paths for us – doing the peaks event). MRT’s do not guide people off the hills and only respond if they consider, given the specific facts of each situation, there is a realistic probability that someone is at risk of coming to harm. At 2235 hrs the Wasdale team leader was on the phone to Howard Christie when they turned up. They had indeed made a navigational error and had eventually been assisted onto the correct route down by other 3 peaks participants.

Without any further information he told the Police that he would not immediately turn the Team out. He would only initiate a call out if he believed there was a reasonable likelihood that people were at risk. He guessed that they were not far off the path and that once people started to walk along what is a main route to Scafell Pike, they would probably be able to contact somebody who would be in a position to assist them navigate. Julian kept trying to contact them every 10 to 15 minutes and eventually got through at about 10.30 am. During his conversation with them, he got them to get their compass and map out and to tell him in what direction certain features lay, relative to their position. e.g.. they could see Sellafield, they could see a valley to their north (Wasdale) and they could see crags in front of them, to their west (crags above Piers Ghyll/corridor route). Julian told them to walk south east for no more than two hundred meters until they came across the path on Broad Crag.
