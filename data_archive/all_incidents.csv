Scafell ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Mon 24th Ma,24-Mar-25,3,2025,2,26 in 2025,Full Callout ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Injured & M,Scafell,"['Clear', 'Cold', 'Dry']","['Air Ambulance', 'Coastguard', 'Cumbria Police', 'Helimed 58', 'Rescue 199 from Prestwick']",Multiple Injuries,Full Callout,Injured & Medical,https://www.wmrt.org.uk/incidents/scafell-mon-24th-mar-2025/,"The team was called out on Monday afternoon by Cumbria Police about a serious incident involving a fallen climber. Two climbers were ascending a crag on Sca Fell, when the lead climber took a large fall. He was seriously injured, unable to communicate and ended the fall suspended on the rope below the second climber. Fortunately, the second climber was uninjured and still secure on the crag, but urgently needed assistance.
The team was very quickly called out and help was requested from a Coastguard helicopter. Helimed 58 also responded quickly. As the team assembled at Brackenclose and prepared the large inventory of rope rescue, medical and other equipment required for a hugely challenging technical rescue, Rescue 199 arrived overhead. With the backup plan to uplift team members high on Sca Fell, saving significant time and effort for team members to get close to the scene, the crew of Rescue 199 took a close look at whether a winch rescue was possible. After some time carefully assessing the risks to all involved, an attempt to winch was made. We donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t normally use superlatives, but with some truly amazing and heroic flying skills and teamwork, they managed to both access and then safely winch the climber directly into the helicopter from his suspended position on the end of the rope. A transfer to Helimed 58 was then completed to allow advanced medical care to be given, before then flying to a suitable hospital.
With the most urgent rescue completed by the helicopter crews, the rescue of the second climber still remained on what is one of the most inaccessible points of the Wasdale MR area. With the offer of further uplift assistance from Rescue 199 still a possibility (but not a guarantee), some members of the team set off on foot with heavy loads to the top of Sca Fell. However, after a refuel of the helicopter, the remaining ten team members were very grateful to get the lift up, comfortably overtaking the hill party. At this point, the technical rope rescue began, with several hundred metres of ro countless other pieces of equipment assuring the safety of both team members and the climber. After some time, in very cold and windy conditions at height, the first rescuer was able to be lowered to the climber. She was able to very bravely and ably assist the rescue, doing most of the work herself to climb and scramble back to safe ground.
After de-rigging, the long walk down to Brackenclose was completed safely and the climber re-united with awaiting family members. The team travelled back to base and spent considerable time checking equipment for damage and resetting the vehicles, before a debrief and finally being stood down to return home.
Our thanks to both helicopter crews, and especially the crew of Rescue 199, whose actions brought the time down for the injured climber getting to definitive medical care by many hours.
We wish both climbers well and offer our very best wishes that the injured climber recovers fully from his injuries. ", Incident started at 14:55 and ended at 01:49 making 10.9 hrs in total.

Further information received via another message indicated that one person was also ill, and another had injured his ankle. They had misnavigated off Scafell Pike summit, attempting to return to Seathwaite. The Team Leader swiftly made a full callout and asked an advance party of two to make their way as quickly as possible to the location. A Coastguard helicopter from Prestwick (Rescue 199) also responded quickly. The assumption at this stage was that the walkers had been lost since the previous afternoon. Further iPhone emergency messages indicated the party was moving down the valley towards the road, although for a time it was unclear whether this was the whole group or just one or two people. Thankfully the advance party had not travelled too far when they met up with the party of five walking out. All were safe and able to complete the journey to the road and then to a local hostelry, where they could organise a taxi back to Borrowdale. The debrief ascertained that the group had set off from North Yorkshire at midnight, arrived at Seathwaite and then set off on their walk at 4am. They had made the summit of Scafell Pike but then found themselves in Upper Eskdale; cold, wet and concerned for their safety. They were not equipped properly for full winter conditions on the high fells, and were also inexperienced. At times they were waist deep in snow.

There was also a separate call for a lone walker that was directed initially to Keswick MRT with an initial location in their area. A full callout was made in case a stretcher carry became needed, and team members made their way to the location. Once on scene, after some additional clothing, calories and reassurance, a slow walk-off proved possible with some direct assistance from team members. It was established on the descent that the group of five walkers accounted for both alerts as the lone walker had met up with the group of four. The descent to Wasdale valley was completed without incident, and the group of five taken back to base for a debrief and to pick up a taxi. However, a taxi proved impossible to source on this occasion at 4am and so two team members unselfishly stayed with the group at base until one became available at 8am.

The team was called by Cumbria Police about two walkers who were descending from Scafell Pike. One of the walkers was very tired and they were concerned that they may not make it back to their vehicle before darkness fell.


The mobile phone signal was marginal so limited information was obtained, and then they could not be re-contacted. On an assumption that they would need help, with cold conditions still at high elevations, a callout was made. However, after about 30 minutes a mobile phone call was possible and the party confirmed that they were making reasonable progress and did not need any assistance. This allowed an early stand down.

When flying and landing in Cumbriaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s mountainous landscape, conditions can change in the blink of an eye, especially at high altitudes.


Our pilots constantly monitor the weather conditions to ensure the safety of our team, but on Saturday, while attending a call-out on Scafell Pike, a dense cloud of fog surrounded our aircraft without warning.


Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re unable to fly in these conditions because of poor visibility and the increased likelihood of icing, which we cannot fly in due to strict guidelines from the Civil Aviation Authority ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the safety of our patients, crew, and equipment is paramount in these situations.


Thankfully, the team was still able to treat the patient we flew out to, and they accompanied them in the descent down the mountain alongside Wasdale Mountain Rescue Team and Duddon and Furness Mountain Rescue Team, but pilot Mik stayed with the aircraft to wait until a break in the clouds appeared.


That break didn n, meaning our helicopter was at the top of Scafell Pike for two days, as the weather conditions did not allow for us to take off safely. Thankfully, Mik was safely accompanied down the mountain on Sunday.


Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re delighted to say that The Pride of Cumbria II was brought back home safe and sound thanks to pilot Stu, who made the three-hour ascent on Monday morning.


Our teams were still on call responding to incidents via our rapid response vehicles and second helicopter, ensuring people in need across Cumbria still had access to our expert doctor and critical care paramedics.


Huge thanks to everyone who helped us get out of this pickle, including the mountain rescue teams, Cumbria Police and Multiflight. Sometimes, itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s not what happens, itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s how you respond to the situation that matters most.

A Father was reporting his son overdue from a walk up Scafell Pike. He had reached the summit successfully at 4pm, however no contact had been possible since. As it was not known which route had been taken, a search of all of the normal car parks was undertaken, with his car discovered at Seathwaite by Keswick MRT. Due to the winter conditions including heavy snowfall at height, lone walker and his inexperience, a full callout was made for a search. Support from Keswick MRT, Duddon and Furness MRT, RAF Leeming, RAF Valley and Coastguard helicopter was requested and received quickly. As teams started their allocated search routes, a further request was made for additional resources from other Lakes teams in the morning for contingency planning. Unfortunately a key search asset Coastguard helicopter Rescue 199 was unable to complete its requested search area of Piers Gill due to low cloud. As such, the Team Leaverted two team members onto this route. Weather conditions of heavy snow and 6 to 12 inches of lying snow at height made search conditions difficult and hazardous, with some parties aborting search routes at higher elevations. At about 2am, shouts from rescuers were rewarded with a faint call back followed by a whistle. Unfortunately it was the party tasked with Piers Gill, with the walkerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s location at the bottom of the gill soon confirmed by searchlight and thermal imaging scope. He confirmed that he had broken his leg and couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t move. His two dogs were located above a waterfall pitch from him, but both seemed fit and well (see part 2). With a technical rope rescue (likely) or helicopter winch (unlikely due to the location and conditions) now the two options, the Team Leader coordinated resources to attempt both. Rescue 936 from Caernarfon this time was tasked to help. Two team members from another search route returned to the team vehicles at Brackenclose to ready medical, stretcher and equipment. Eight loads of equipment were required, with only two team members, so Rescue 936 agreed to uplift the rescuers and equipment as close as possible. The RAF MR teams were closest to the scene so were redirected, with a total of 13 rescuers. With the weather improving and cloud base lifting, Rescue 936 attempted to directly access the walker, but this was not possible. Then, having found a landing site at Middleboot Knotts, they returned to Brackenclose to pickup the two team members and equipment. The RAF teams collected the extra equipment from the landing site and returned to scene. Rescue 936 left the area to refuel. 
A team casualty carer was then lowered via a side gully into the bottom of the gill, with further rescuers and equipment following. It was quickly established that the walker had suffered serious injuries and was very cold, but thankfully he had managed to find a small shelf to keep himself mostly out of the



























water. Medical assessment and treatment was given and cold wet clothing exchanged for dry in a bivvy shelter. As quickly as possible in very challenging conditions a stretcher, casualty bag, heat blankets, vacuum mattress and dual rope system was also established, and then the walker was packaged securely. The haul out of the gill was completed to the awaiting team members.
 Rescue 936 then returned to scene and winched the casualty, before transferring swiftly to hospital for further assessment and treatment. After the remaining team members were retrieved from the gill, equipment was packed up and the teams walked wearily back to Brackenclose. Once back at base at about noon all team members enjoyed much needed food and refreshments kindly prepared by other members. All in all, a very challenging search and rescue in winter conditions. Once more, great teamwork and support from all teams. Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d particularly like to thank the visiting RAF teams and Rescue 936 for their help on scene. We wish the walker all the best and hope he recoveully from his injuries. 
All that remained was to rescue the walkerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s two dogs. Additional team members with support from Duddon and Furness MRT had been obtained in the background with fresh legs ascending whilst tired ones came downï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Part 2 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Dog rescue:


Team members from Duddon and Furness MRT and Wasdale volunteered to rescue the walkerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s two dogs. They were cragfast and unable to reach their owner below.


As the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½nightshiftï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ clocked off and returned to base, the relief dayshift was heading up the fell.


Once on scene, ropes were again used to keep team members safe whilst descending steep snowy ground to locate the dogs. They were encouraged gently with the lure of hotdogs back up the hill to safety and then back to base to be reunited later with family members.

A lone male walker was reported overdue by a friend, having declared an intent to climb Scafell. He had left home early the previous morning, likely setting off on the fell at about 7:30am. The police had checked car parks and located his car at Brackenclose. Very limited additional information was known, other than he had intended to return the same day before the weather deteriorated (early afternoon). With team members recovering from the previous callout, coupled with the prospect of a major search on both Scafell and Scafell Pike, (walkers often talk about Scafell but really mean Scafell Pike) the Team Leader escalated the callout to regional level, requesting support from all other Lake District teams. The poor weather of the previous day made the search urgent due to risk of hypothermia. Visibility was still poor and the temperature was forecasted to drop further through the day. An initial Wasdale party set off at 04:42, and then other teams were tasked as they arrived at base, or remotely if that saved time. Search dogs and coastguard helicopter support was also received. As the digital map began to fill with many traces of individual rescuers, a shout was heard by the Cockermouth MRT team from the bottom of Piers Gill. The team were able to access the location with a rope system. Unfortunately the walker had suffered injuries to both ankles, amongst other injuries, and as such medical treatment and evacuation by stretcher was required. He had been in the gill injured for about 24 hours by this point having mis-navigated on his descent from the summit. Other teams on the hill then migrated to the evacuation point with further medical equipment. Specialist rope rescue equipment, stretcher, and further casualty packaging was flown from the valley with additional team members by Coastguard helicopter Rescue 199. Medical assessment and treatment was given in the gill before a technical rescue was then undertaken, led by the Cockermouth team and with assistance from all the other teams present. Having done the hard bit, the normally straightforward part of either a stretcher carry or helicopter transport from the scene proved difficult. With weather conditions thwarting a helicopter extraction, and steep ground below preventing a descent by stretcher, the safest and quickest option was an uphill carry to Lingmell Col. After an energy sapping journey, also helped by a passing Assynt MRT team member, the walker was transferred into the care of the awaiting Helimed 58 crew. He was then flown to hospital for further treatment. We wish the walker a quick recovery from his injuries. Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d like to offer huge thanks to all supporting teams and agencies, including offers received later in the morning and not required. This is an example of fantastic multiagency working (both voluntary and professional) to get the best possible outcome for the walker.

In the first of two callouts in quick succession, a party of 4 young and inexperienced walkers reported themselves lost, wet, cold and concerned for their safety. They had seemingly mis-navigated in poor conditions off the summit and then lost the path.


The Team Leader directed them back to the summit from where a talk-off is possible, but one of the walkers was struggling to walk. As such a full callout was made for a potential stretcher carry. However, a further call was made from the party shortly afterwards with better news that they were back on a path and heading downhill in the right direction.


After this no further communication was possible to confirm location or progress. It was expected that team members ascending would meet the walkers coming down but this did not occur. With concern that another wrong turn had been made, in worsening conditions, further team members were requested and Duddon and Furness MRT called to search Upper Eskdale.


However as one of the additional team vehicles arrived at the car park at Brackenclose, the group were found at their vehicle having made their own way down. Somehow they had managed to accidentally avoid team members going up the fell. This was still very good news and all team members were recalled to base to warm up, refuel and overwhelm the drying room.


Thanks to Duddon and Furness MRT for their help once more.

They had split up close to the summit, with the male walker ascending the final stretch in the mist, intending to return within a short time. When the male walker failed to return, and after a phone call saying that he had lost the path and was scrambling down on steep ground the informant was increasingly concerned when no further contact was possible. The Team Leader made a full callout and also asked a team member in the valley to travel direct to help the informant off the hill and obtain further information. At this point she had almost made it back to Brackenclose. With lots of uncertainty, and the possibility of a search over a large area, Duddon and Furness MRT was asked to search the paths in Eskdale. Additionally two search dogs were given taskings. With 27 pairs of boots (and eight paws) on the ground in both valleys, the teams made their way uphill. After a couple of false alarms, a Wasdale hill party heard shouts from Piers Gill. On further careful investigation over the edge, a light was seen and soon it was confirmed that the walker was in a precarious position at the bottom of the gill. Fortunately he was able to stand and shout back to team members. All Wasdale parties converged and proceeded to set up rope access to enable team members to safely descend. Once on scene the walker was confirmed to have taken a few tumbles, and was soaking wet, but after some warming, food and extra clothing he was able to manage an assisted climb out of the gill. Once back on safe ground, he was further assessed and debriefed. He had suffered many abrasions from scrambling, slipping and sliding down treacherous ground on the descent in the gill. Due to this it was decided to take the longer but safer route back up to Lingmell Col before descending finally to Brackenclose. An ambulance was also requested as a precaution to further assess the walker. At Brackenclose, the two walkers were finally reunited, before being taken to hospital for a full assessment. The teams returned to their respective bases to reset the vehicles in readiness for the next callout. This was a great outcome given the location.

He was becoming cold having stopped in the exposed terrain.
Due to a possible stretcher carry a full team callout was made. Duddon and Furness MRT were also asked for availability due to slightly low numbers for a long carry off the fell. Fortunately two team members were already on the hill in different locations, but both agreed to change their plans and divert to assess the situation and see if they could help.
Once on scene, the walker was assessed and it was decided to attempt to walk slowly down to Wasdale Head. Fortunately this was possible and the two team members escorted the walker to the Wasdale Head Inn for some replenishment of calories, hydration and to arrange a taxi for onwards transport.

Initially we asked for support from Cockermouth MRT as they can access this location more easily however shortly after agreeing to help they needed to respond to another call-out in their area. Due to the location and likelihood of serious injuries a Coastguard helicopter was also requested and Rescue 199 from Prestwick was dispatched quickly. They reached the scene and winched their paramedic to the scene to begin treatment. The helicopter then ferried Wasdale MRT team members to the scene to support. The injured paraglider received strong pain relief and was transferred carefully into the vacuum mattress for full body stabilisation.

Cumbria Police alerted us to a report from a concerned family member. A group of two male walkers, plus a dog  (Dexter) had failed to make contact from an intended walk up Scafell Pike and were overdue. Due to the weather conditions, and real potential for hypothermia, a full callout was made and additional support gained from Duddon and Furness MRT and the Lake District search dogs. No contact was able to be made by mobile phone, so we did not have any real leadsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ as to which areas to search. Search teams were sent via the normal routes in Wasdale and Eskdale. The team sent to Sty Head were clearly barking up the wrong tree and found nothing. Other teams were poodling around for some time with nothing heard or seen. However, the search team in Hollow Stones heard a woof and a howl in response to their whistles, and so we finally had a Scooby Doo. The hunt was on. A light was seen high on the flanks of Scafell, but due to the mist it was very difficult l exactly where. Dogged determination kept the teams searching in Lordï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Rake, up Black Crag and in Red Gill. Finally a clear line of sight could be made and fortunately the group was thankfully found to be dogfast rather than cragfast, on steep ground but manageable with care. Dexter, the 40kg Doberman/Belgian Malinois cross had decided not to move any further on nightfall, despite much encouragement. The walkers were uninjured, cold, and had not wanted to leave their dog on the fell. They were equipped well enough to spend an unplanned night on the fell, and we found that Dexter was trained to bark and howl, thus initially attracting our attention. Other rescuers harnessed the energy to make the hard pull up to their location but no amount of encouragement could make Dexter move downhill. The agreed course of action was to wait for daylight and hope that he regained his confidence to move downhill with better visibility. As such, bivvy shelters were deployed for all, and a long paws ensued. After a ight, as dawn broke, further attempts were made but Dexter stood fast. As hope was fading a last ditch attempt was made with a 50m rope lead and he was gently encouraged downhill . Thankfully once he started moving there were no further problems and a brisk, boisterous and friendly walk with Dexter was then made back to Brackenclose. The team wearily were recalled to base and the vehicles were reset. A friendly team member had kindly played fetch with breakfast butties from the local shop. After gratefully consuming these, the team returned home for a lie down. Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d like to thank Duddon and Furness MRT and Lake District Mountain Rescue Search Dogs for their rapid response to an initially urgent search.

Unfortunately the mobile signal was very poor and the informant was not able to be called back for further information, despite many attempts. With a vast area to search and no indication of location it was agreed with the police to review and attempt to contact the informant again in the morning. At 08:45 the following morning, the police received another call saying that different walkers had heard shouts for help from a gully between Great End and Broad Crag. The team was called out quickly, now that a good location was apparent. However, an hour later the informant phoned again to update ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he and his son had investigated and managed to find the lost group who were actually a party of three, plus dog. They were all cold but otherwise fit and well. The party was guided back down to the Corridor Routee team members met up with them.

A walker on the path on the East side of the gill had noticed them after they were shouting for help. They appeared to be unhurt but this was from a significant distance away. The Team Leader made a swift callout and also contacted Duddon and Furness MRT for additional crag support, knowing this could be a difficult technical rescue in the worst case. Both teams met at Gavel Neese and made their way up to the likely access point.
As any rope access into Piers Gill is inherently hazardous, helicopter support was also requested via a Coastguard helicopter with winching capability. Rescue 199 from Prestwick duly attended but unfortunately were not able to effect the rescue via winch due to the weather conditions requiring high power and the resulting significant downdraft creating a real risk to the walkers below. They returned home to their base in Scotland.
A rope rescue was therefore needed and the teams rigged a rope system and then descended to the walkers. Once on scene it was quickly realised that the condition of the casualties was more serious than had been thought. The walkers had been stuck in this position for about 24 hours and had suffered injuries from slips and falls. Helicopter support was again requested for a swift evacuation from the scene once the walkers had been evacuated by rope from the gill. Rescue 199 returned and with some tremendous flying were able to land close to the teams for a short transfer. The first casualty was flown down to the valley where other team members made a more thorough assessment. After extraction, R199 then received the second casualty on a stretcher, flew down to the valley, picked up the first casualty, and then flew both to hospital for further assessment and treatment.

Unfortunately for us, this location is one of the most remote on our ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½patchï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (and possibly the whole of the Lake District) so this required long walks in by small groups from both Wasdale and Eskdale. Shortly after setting off, the Eskdale team came across another group of misplaced walkers, unfortunately they were not the group they were looking for. They were 3-peakers who wero the wrong valley. Eventually the Wasdale group found the casualty party of walkers (as it turned out, three!) in roughly the location expected. The walkers were then escorted back to Wasdale and then to base for the subsequent long and expensive taxi journey. Both parties were not adequately equipped in terms of navigation equipment or skills. Misty conditions do make navigation challenging, and especially so, high on the Scafell Massif. Fortunately on this occasion the only consequences were time, effort, discomfort, missed objectives, cost for taxis, and some damaged pride. However, the risks to safety are very real, both in terms of hypothermia (yes, even in August if there is poor weather) and crag fast or fall risk if walkers stray into the wrong areas. Please share to raise awareness, as many walkers we encounter do still underestimate the difficulty of navigating in mist and/or darkness.

After some difficulty in being able to make direct contact to ascertain the exact location and circumstances, a full callout was made. Due to slightly low numbers assistance was requested from Duddon and Furness MRT. Members from Bowland and Pennine MRT also happened to be on the hill and nearby so kindly offered their assistance. Once team members were on scene, a full medical assessment was made, and it was decided that due to the mechanism of injury (a tumble fall of 20m), and a long and difficult stretcher carry out to a road head, helicopter assistance was required. Helimed 58 duly responded and was able to land on flat ground near Pulpit Rock. Attempts to get closer were thwarted by gusty winds. As such, an energy sapping uphill carry was still required, with helicopter medics in attendance, after which the walker was flown to hospital for further assessment and treatment. We wish the walker a swift recovery, and massive thanks to all other MR teams that helped. Thanks also to the Helimed team for getting as close as they could in difficult conditions and terrain. Some fantastic multi-team working once again.

As such the larger capacity Coastguard helicopter R199 agreed to support us and mobilise from Prestwick. In the meantime team members ascended into the mist and were able to assess the casualty. He bravely was able to walk with assistance for a while which saved a period of hazardous stretcher carry for us over very tricky ground. He was then transferred to a stretcher for the remaining distance to Lingmell Col where a suitable landing site below the cloud had been located. A transfer to the helicopter took place and the walker was taken to hospital for further treatment. The teams then descended back to the valley and returned to respective bases to restock the vehicles for the next callout. We wish the walker a swift recovery, and huge thanks once again to the crews of R199 and H58 for their help.

A late evening call came on Wednesday night when Cumbria Police alerted us to a lone walker who was cragfast. This was initially reported to be on Broad Stand, but on checking the coordinates from the police call, was confirmed to be slightly further South to our ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½normalï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ crag job on the East Buttress of Scafell.


Care was taken to understand the exact nature of his predicament as deploying rescue teams immediately in the dark in a crag environment without sleep carries its own risks. On balance, it was decided to deploy as he was on a small ledge with a significant drop beneath, safe in the short term but not to leave for many more hours.


Coastguard helicopter support was requested quickly, as a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½pick offï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ winch by them might have been possible. However cloud had descended in the area and, after several attempts, Rescue 199 from Prestwick returned home for fuel, and the teams made their way up the hill for a rope rend Furness MRT.


Having ascended Scafell, it took some time for the Wasdale team to establish the best and safest access route, from close to the summit. This involved a diagonal lower of the rescuer. This also meant the casualty was less at risk from rockfall from the rescuer and belay party. Rope protection was used to descend to the point where they could establish belay anchors for the lower.


However, at about 3am the clouds lifted sufficiently to attempt another helicopter rescue, and this time Rescue 936 from Caernarfon lifted to support. However, when it arrived, the winch rescue was also assessed to be very risky, so plan A became the rope rescue. The Wasdale team was now in position and a rescuer descended to the cragfast person. The team members below at Mickledore needed to guide the rescuer to the correct location as this was not visible from above. Once on the scene the walker was successfully secured with a harness and attached to the rope for a protected down-climb to safety below. Most of the team members then followed and abseiled down with the excess equipment.


The teams and walker were very grateful for the support from the crew of R936 who gave lifts back down to the valley after a long night. The remaining two (unlucky!) Wasdale team members de-rigged and descended by foot back to the valley, as again the helicopter was low on fuel and had to depart. Hearty breakfasts back at base for all were gratefully received after an ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½all-nighterï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and the vehicles were then restocked for the next callout.


Many thanks to the crew of Rescue 199 and 936 and Duddon and Furness MRT once again. Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re also sorry if local residents were disturbed by the helicopter activity. A tricky job with great teamwork, and an excellent outcome.

The team received a call yesterday evening from Cumbria Police about a lone walker who was tired and worried about being able to safely return to Seathwaite in the dark. She had no torch, was inexperienced on the high fells and had low battery life on her mobile phone. She had set off in the afternoon at 2.30pm. As she was not lost and on a path with walkers still on the fell, she was advised to take the shorter route down to Wasdale with others from other groups. However, contact was lost and she did not confirm she was safely back in a valley overnight, so a search was initiated by both Keswick MRT and Wasdale in the morning. Search dogs were also called out. Fortunately shortly after the callout it was confirmed that she had made it safely down, after spending the night somewhere around Middleboot Knotts. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a good reminder that although the nights are short at this time of the year, adequate equipment is still needed if there are delays or things go wrong.

Displaying signs of pain in her rear legs and refusing to move, Daisyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½nss the weather was due to deteriorate later that evening. In advance of getting on location advice had been sought from several local vets regarding pain relief, possible issues specific to that breed of dog and how best to handle them in such stressful situations.  On reaching their location, team members carefully introduced themselves to Daisy so as not to cause any additional distress, and with the help of a treat or two members were able to assess her condition and administer analgesia for the pain.  A few different tactics needed to be tried until both Daisy and her stretcher bearers were all satisfied and progress down-hill could be made. It had become quickly apparent that Daisyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s cooperation was going to be essential if we were to make progress as Daisy made sure we knew that if she didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want to do something, she wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t going to do it.

During the county wide flooding in early December the west of the county was fortunately less badly affected and the Wasdale team took on the role of helping to coordinate the response elsewhere as well as providing a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Type Cï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ team of swiftwater rescue technicians. This article presents an overview of the events between Sat 5th ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Sun 7th December. Early on Saturday morning it was apparent that it had rained hard for a long time and was likely to do so for a lot longer. The morning teleconferences started to conclude that a major flood incident was likely and soon tasks were coming in, particularly around Keswick and Kendal. Around lunchtime Keswick were dealing with a large number of jobs and support was sent from Cockermouth, Wasdale and Duddon teams. Kendal also staride were tasked to help rescue people from a bus trapped by landslides on the A591. At this point it started to become apparent that the incident would go on for a long time in many different places and if the MR effort was to keep pace further support was needed. Calls went out to the other regions to ask what help they might be able to offer ? Later on Saturday evening Cockermouth started to flood as well and the main street became a river once again. There was now activity in every MR base in Cumbria, except for Patterdale, which was flooded. Despite the west of Cumbria being relatively unaffected there was a 6 strong team in the Wasdale base helping to keep an overview of events elsewhere. Operations continued through the night around the county. On Sunday the focus started to shift to Carlisle. The out of county teams were important to the MR effort in Carlisle as many of the local teams were busy in their own areas. During the Sunday groups from the Peak District, Calder Valley, Ogwen / North Wales, Swaledale, Upper Wharfdale, Kirkby Stephen, Coniston, Penrith and Wasdale teams were all deployed in Carlisle. Bowland Pennine and CRO also supported in the south of the county. Away from Carlisle operations were still ongoing in Cockermouth and Kendal and new fronts started to open up. Penrith had a number of incidents in Eamont Bridge. Kirkby Stephen were called to help with evacuations in Appleby. Patterdale, now displaced from their base, supported this effort and also helped with the rescue of an Ullswater steamer that broke free from its moorings. Duddon team helped to move Kidney Dialysis patients in the south of the county. Operations continued through Sunday night but by now it was apparent that the pace had to slow, not just because the swiftwater teams were tired but it was also becoming difficult to man the various supporting roles in the bases. Into Monday and there was still flooding in Carlisle and the east of the county but the water was starting to go down slowly elsewhere. The effort continued in Carlisle with mainly local teams from Duddon, Penrith and Wasdale along with the second team to come up from Ogwen. It was known earlier in the weekend that things were difficult in Patterdale but the picture that started to emerge through the day was a community without power, water or telephone links and had been cut off for 2 days due to collapse of Pooley Bridge. The Patterdale team started to get back into the village and with their limited communications provide a picture of the conditions down the valley. By the evening the flood waters had receded in most places and it was only in Patterdale that MR operations continued. ", Incident started at 07:00.

LEARNING ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Both of these incident we have dealt with this evening have been a direct result of groups becoming separated whilst on the hill for varying reasons. It is essential that if you are in a group that you stay together unless the situation dictates that someone must get help. Especially if your equipment is spread across the group. Further to this, the current weather forecast is predicated to get rather cold over the weekend with snow on the hills, winter is in mountains and you should go prepared with a torch, plenty of warm and waterproof clothing and a map / compass.
Please take note of the learning above and understand if you are going to comment on the above that you do not have the whole picture of the groups situation at the time of these events. WMRT.

The team leader quizzed them for over an hour on their mobile to establish where they were and understand the clues they were giving as to location.  Their descriptions of having seen a white cross made of stones put their route as Scafell and not Scafell Pike.  They had done a lot of turning left and right and walking on snowy footprints without a clue what direction they were actually heading in.  They had originally come up out of Eskdale on a three day camping expedition.  After passing over Scafell it would appear that they may have got all the way down Shamrock / Red Gill area and then gone over to Lingmell. Other descriptions did not help the location however sufficient information was given to give reasonably safe direction for descent.  They continued down the mountain with periodic checks by mobile phone.  Eventualrs they reported they were well down the mountain in a valley and no longer required the services of mountain rescue.

Although a dog, he was a well proportioned heavy boned animal approaching 6 stones in weight.

A 44 year old male had fallen over a boulder on the summit of Scafell Pike and had been reported as having injuries to his face and a possible limb injury.  The mobile phone was called but there was no answer (no signal?).  The party had set off for Scafell Pike along the corridor route via Styhead Pass.  Not being able to contact the informant, (a number of attempts were made), it was not known at which end of the corridor route the casualty was to be found.  Casualty was eventually found near Skew Gill on the Corridor route.  Keswick team had been asked to assist but were subsequently stood down when the casualties condition and location was established.  The gash to the head had been sustained on Scafell Pike and he had made his way back down with a bandaged head.  There were no other injuries.  The team doctor checked him over and he was able to make his own way off the fell with the assistanoup.  His support vehicle (he was part of a group doing the 4 x 3,000 peaks) was waiting for him at Seathwaite.  The incident was closed at around 3.00 p.m. It was subsequently established that the injured person had not called the team and was unaware that the team were looking for him whilst he made his way down the mountain.  It had been a bystander who had decided to call the team but unfortunately not stayed put to receive subsequent calls from the team.It is worth remembering that when a  ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½999ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ call is made for mountain rescue it is vital that the informant stays in a position where they can be contacted and also gives clear details of exact location, what has happened, when it happened, who is injured and what the injuries are.  The team leader will call back to discuss.The following is a message from the casualty to put the record straight on what actually happened that day Richard I would like to update entry of my incident this year :6/23:24/06/06 (  11:07 hrs ) ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Saturday Alby the doctor on the mountain and allowed to walk to Seathwaite, I did in fact have a fractured Eye orbit, with severed nerves and eventually impaired vision. the gash I also sustained has cleared up to a lovely scar and the vision back to near normal, however the nerves may take up to 2 years and Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m still numb on parts of the left side of the face and gums. The break has healed on its own with no need for surgery that was discussed at length in the days that followed The number you were given by the police was in fact, uselessly, mine. but as I was out of any signal range walking down the corridor route I never got the calls till back in the hospital that night. The subsequent call to chastise me received a few days later left no number and was from an unobptainable number so I could not reply and set the record right. I have just seen the entry on the web page and thought I ought to put the record straight. I was as you say in the report unaware throughout that you were looking for me and had indeesed help on the way down from other walkers most of which were very keen to get the helicopter out ( i guess out of concern and the spectacle it would have caused) I organise the charity event that i was part of and take H&S very seriously, we have risk assessments of all our events, clear processes and plans for emergencies and injuries and a support team throughout including first aiders and first aid equipment with us on the walks. I got the distinct impression from the comments left on my phone and in this report that i in some wasted your time and was not worthy of your attention on that day. hopefully the injuries that i did sustain will go someway in correcting the view. I am self sufficient by nature and was not keen on making a fuss however although I personally did not call you out I still feel that the those that did, made a good call based on the facts they had before them at the top of Scafell Pike. The final point was that the facts they gave the police were that the number given was mine, they gave the number of those in our party the time we left the summit our direction and route. the police seemed comfortable that this was exactly what you needed to mount the correct level of support at the time.. they also agreed that as it was freezing cold and blowing a gale at the top that if I could walk it would be best to do so. Clearly not interested in entering some great debate on this, merely to set the record straight as I will be up there again next year with a group, yep not put off despite everything!! despite all of this I would like to donate money to the mountain rescue as the role you all perform is tremendous and worthy. Not sure how much would be useful for you so it would be great if you could give me a call to see what we could arrange Could you please let me know how i do this and if you have the time please give me a call on my mobile ", Incident started at 11:07. ,11:07,,,,,,

From what the informant could tell it was found difficult to determine whether the casualty had indeed suffered a genuine injury (which the team would always respond to) or whether the injury was actually better classified as a knee strain.  Either way, as a general point, it helps prioritize the right levels of response and back up required if  informants give more detail when requesting MR assistance.  e.g. location and injury and what sort of event caused it].Post event note ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the walker had a knee injury when he had done Ben Nevis previously that day and this was the other knee which was a coruscate ligament failure- he had to be fireman carried back down so well  carrying but they would probably have been better staying put and getting him down on a stretcher.

A party of nine had set off from Brotherilkeld with their leader to climb Scafell.  After reaching the summit, a navigational error put the group at the top of Broad Stand.  The leader had wisely decided not to descend but retrace his steps back up to the summit ridge.  Although mid April, the Lake District was experiencing pretty nasty winter conditions and there was fresh, snow on the ground above 2000 foot and cloud down to 1000 feet  Once the group were back on the ridge there was a dispute and two of them walked off and left the leader with a dilemma.  As a result the team were called in and search parties were sent in from both sides of Scafell.  Fortunately, two walkers descending, high on the flank of Scafell on the Wasdale side were seen by one team member, approached and quickly identified as the missing pair.  The two walkers were reassured and safely walked back down to the vehicles at Brackenclose and driven back to Gosforth to wait for their colleagues who were descending back to their vehicle in Eskdale.  When the Wasdale vehicles arrived back in Gosforth, one of the two missing walkers became very agitated and irrational and decided to head off into the surrounding countryside, quickly followed by a small group of team members.  They eventually caught up with the individual and the situation brought under control.  In order to bring the situation to a final safe conclusion, Police back up was requested.

The team leader and a friend were out for a scramble on Scafell when they came across a 70 year old man on the Foxes Tarn descent route.  The man from Lancashire, had been dropped off at Boot, Eskdale by his wife and was heading for the Band on Bowfell to be picked up again at Old Dungeon Gill, Langdale.  He had taken a fall but was alright and was slowly making his way down.  Noting the lateness of the day, that he was moving slowly and that he did not have a light the Team Leader decided to walk down to Sampsonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Stones with him (Upper Eskdale), lend him a torch and see him safely on his way across to Three Tarns.When the Team Leader got home he called the leader of the Langdale Ambleside team to advise that the guy would be making his way down in the dark but was fine.  If there were calls made to the police for whareason then at least he would know about the person and intended route.  Nothing further happened until early the next morning when the manï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s wife phoned the police to say she was worried about him being so overdue.  Shortly after the wifeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s call to the Police, the man phoned his wife on the mobile to say he was safely on his way down. He eventually got down safely the next day and called the Team leader to thank him for the loan of the torch and to explain the events of the previous day.He had made his way to Green Hole (at the top of Eskdale), worked his way up and into the crags and mist and lost his route.  Recognising that he would not get off the mountain that night, he descended to a safe area and phoned his wife to say that he would not be down to meet her that night but not to worry as he was happy to find a place to sleep in the shelter of the rocks.  At first light he started back up but was unable to call his wife on the mobile to reassure her due to no signal.  She had started to his condition again in the morning when she had not heard from him so called the police.  He called her as soon as he got a signal and then made his way down the Band.  A story with a happy ending.

The informant was at Brotherilkeld Farm.  A full team callout was immediately made and the team set off to the top of Eskdale, Green Hole being some 3 km from the road head which would be along walk (run) in and a difficult carry out depending on his injuries.  The cloud was down so a helicopter evacuation was not possible.The poor visibility made locating the casualty extremely difficult and it progressed into a major search.  Langdale and Ambleside team were asked in to help who also involved Kendal team.  There were also a number a search dogs deployed.  In all there were probably 50 team members on the hill.  The casualty was found at around midnight, high up  Eskdale side of Crinkle Crags, a long way off the path in Rusty Gill.  He had sustained a nasty gash to his head but had remained conscious.  He could not walk and was laying in the bottom of the very steep sided gill. He was extremely cold and wet after his ordeal in the gill but had warmed up quickly once in the casualty bag.  He was manually lifted out of the gill (he was a heavy man at 16 stone) and carried some 300 metres along the side of the crag on very steep and unstable ground.  In many areas the stretcher had to be manhandled between team members, hand over hand, which is a very slow process.  At around 0130 hrs he was safely down off the crags but there was still a long carry out to Cockley Beck via Mosedale.  A request for RAF helicopter assistance had been made on two occasions through the night but due to the very poor weather and imminent bad weather front, the crews were unable to assist.All the team vehicles were sent round the Cockley Beck ( bottom of Hardknott Pass on the Wrynose side) and there were some 12 team vehicles there when the stretcher party arrived.  This included the Langdale Ambleside ambulance which was possibly going to be used to convey the casualty back over Hardknott Pass to the waiting ambulance at Brotherilkeld telephone box.  The casualty was eventually taken off to West Cumberland Hospital and is recovering well with relatively minor injuries and some heavy bruising to his back and knee.  The incident was over by 0400hrs which allowed team members to get home, have a shower and a nap before going to work.The local media were reporting the incident the following morning.  The Whitehaven News spoke to the team leader who gave them the details but also discussed the continuing existence of the Hard Knott British Telecomm Phone Box.  There is a proposal to remove it but the Teamï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s view is to support itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s retention.  There is no mobile reception in Eskdale, the first phone for 5 miles and used frequently by groups that get lost on Scafell and go down the wront is still in the middle of nowhere at the bottom of Hard Knott and is vital for reporting accidents quickly.  It was used when the RAF helicopter crashed in 1991 to sort out logistics and is used regularly to report road traffic accidents.

The group consisted of two adults (in their thirties) and two girls (aged 14 and 16). There was little information regarding their experience or the equipment they might be carrying but their wives had given an intended route which would have taken them from Seathwaite, up Scafell Pike and then back to Seatoller via Glaramara and Thornythwaite Fell. The whole group were staying in a guest house in Ambleside. As much of their intended route (including their start and finish) would be within the Keswick MRT area, the team leader passed the details over to the Keswick MRT, Team Leader and the two Team Leaders jointly worked on the incident from there on. Keswick were able to confirm that the missing personï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s vehicle was indeed still parked near Seathwaite and they spoke to the wives, to see if they could get any more useful information before we commenced a search for them. Full call outs of Keswi Wasdale MRTs were initiated at 0120 hrs and the one remaining search dog handler left in the Lake District (while all the rest were away training in Scotland) was also called in to assist. The two teams jointly covered all the major routes around Scafell Pike and the ridge over to Glaramara and eventually located the missing walkers in Eskdale at around 0700 hrs. They had made a navigational error and become lost. They were tired and cold but otherwise unhurt and were therefore assisted to walk off the mountain, before being given a lift back to where they were staying in Ambleside. Conditions on the summits were quite cold and windy and low cloud was causing very poor visibility, particularly during the night. All parties were re-called off the hill and returned to base by around 0930 hrs, 2001-08-21.Rescue postscript: The team leader subsequently spoke to the deputy team leader, whoï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s group were the ones that found the four missing walkers. It seems they stayed on their intended route up to the sum Scafell Pike but that they then went to Mickledore and descended into Upper Eskdale via the side of the Cam Spout waterfall. From there, they attempted to find Esk Hause, to continue over Glaramara but got lost somewhere. We think they spent the night sheltering in a small sheep fold somewhere on the south side of the Esk/Cam Spout area and on the flanks of Esk Pike. They were not very experienced walkers and had not been well equipped to cope with the enforced bivi. It was perhaps fortunate that they found shelter relatively low down and out of the wind as the tops would have been much more unpleasant. The search dog handler from Ambleside gave them all a lift back from Eskdale, in his car. They did not report hearing any shouts or seeing lights of rescuers.

(A County Ambulance was already on itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s way but due to the remote location at the head of the valley, the Teamï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s response is quicker). On examining the casualty, it became apparent that his chest pain was more likely tcaused by impact from a fall.

He did not have a map with him and we were given information about his previous medical history which gave us cause for concern. With incident 48 below, we now had two incidents on the go.

We put them in helmets and harnesses and assisted them to walk down. Very slow going, with us getting back to Wasdale Head at 10.30pm. The moral of the story : we are seeing an increasing trend that when people use their mobile phones to summon assistance, a lot of them donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t actually know where they are! We can cope better if those people admit to being lost, rather than give us what appears to confident information on their location, only for us to find that theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re on a different mountain.

Three women (aged between 35 and 45) had used a mobile phone to call 999 for assistance. They reported that they had lost the path in thick mist and were lost, probably somewhere between Broad Crag and Scafell Pike. They were apparently well equipped but were worried about how they would get back to a mini bus (and husband) at the Old Dungeon Ghyll, Langdale. The Police had advised them to stay put until they were contacted by the MRT. Julian Carradice, WMRT Team Leader tried to contact them but could only get an answer phone service (a common problem !!!) Without any further information he told the Police that he would not immediately turn the Team out. He would only initiate a call out if he believed there was a reasonable likelihood that people were at risk. He guessed that they were not far off the path and that once people started to walk along what is a main route to Scafell Pike, they would probably be able to contact somebody who would be in a position to assist them navigate. Julian kept trying to contact them every 10 to 15 minutes and eventually got through at about 10.30 am. During his conversation with them, he got them to get their compass and map out and to tell him in what direction certain features lay, relative to their position. e.g.. they could see Sellafield, they could see a valley to their north (Wasdale) and they could see crags in front of them, to their west (crags above Piers Ghyll/corridor route). Julian told them to walk south east for no more than two hundred meters until they came across the path on Broad Crag. (They had been going from Langdale and were still heading for the summit of the Pike when they got off route) Julian rang them again after 10 to 15 minutes and confirmed that they had regained the path. He then convinced them to head back towards Langdale and that they would warm up as they did this (they had been out since 05.30 am and were very cold and wet.) Julian had further contact with them on two more occasions until he knew they were safely back at Esk Hause. At this point the three ladies were now much happier and knew where they were going.
