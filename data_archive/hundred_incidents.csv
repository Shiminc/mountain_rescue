Two climbers were ascending a crag on Sca Fell, when the lead climber took a large fall. He was seriously injured, unable to communicate and ended the fall suspended on the rope below the second climber. Fortunately, the second climber was uninjured and still secure on the crag, but urgently needed assistance.
The team was very quickly called out and help was requested from a Coastguard helicopter. Helimed 58 also responded quickly. As the team assembled at Brackenclose and prepared the large inventory of rope rescue, medical and other equipment required for a hugely challenging technical rescue, Rescue 199 arrived overhead. With the backup plan to uplift team members high on Sca Fell, saving significant time and effort for team members to get close to the scene, the crew of Rescue 199 took a close look at whether a winch rescue was possible. After some time carefully assessing the risks to all involved, an attempt to winch was made. We don’t normally use superlatives, but with some truly amazing and heroic flying skills and teamwork, they managed to both access and then safely winch the climber directly into the helicopter from his suspended position on the end of the rope. A transfer to Helimed 58 was then completed to allow advanced medical care to be given, before then flying to a suitable hospital.
With the most urgent rescue completed by the helicopter crews, the rescue of the second climber still remained on what is one of the most inaccessible points of the Wasdale MR area. With the offer of further uplift assistance from Rescue 199 still a possibility (but not a guarantee), some members of the team set off on foot with heavy loads to the top of Sca Fell. However, after a refuel of the helicopter, the remaining ten team members were very grateful to get the lift up, comfortably overtaking the hill party. At this point, the technical rope rescue began, with several hundred metres of rope and countless other pieces of equipment assuring the safety of both team members and the climber. After some time, in very cold and windy conditions at height, the first rescuer was able to be lowered to the climber. She was able to very bravely and ably assist the rescue, doing most of the work herself to climb and scramble back to safe ground.
After de-rigging, the long walk down to Brackenclose was completed safely and the climber re-united with awaiting family members. The team travelled back to base and spent considerable time checking equipment for damage and resetting the vehicles, before a debrief and finally being stood down to return home.
Our thanks to both helicopter crews, and especially the crew of Rescue 199, whose actions brought the time down for the injured climber getting to definitive medical care by many hours.
We wish both climbers well and offer our very best wishes that the injured climber recovers fully from his injuries. ", Incident started at 14:55 and ended at 01:49 making 10.9 hrs in total.

Helpfully an exact location was obtained, although this was in a remote area in Upper Eskdale. Further information received via another message indicated that one person was also ill, and another had injured his ankle. They had misnavigated off Scafell Pike summit, attempting to return to Seathwaite. The Team Leader swiftly made a full callout and asked an advance party of two to make their way as quickly as possible to the location. A Coastguard helicopter from Prestwick (Rescue 199) also responded quickly. The assumption at this stage was that the walkers had been lost since the previous afternoon. Further iPhone emergency messages indicated the party was moving down the valley towards the road, although for a time it was unclear whether this was the whole group or just one or two people. Thankfully the advance party had not travelled too far when they met up with the party of five walking out. All were safe and able to complete the journey to the road and then to a local hostelry, where they could organise a taxi back to Borrowdale. The debrief ascertained that the group had set off from North Yorkshire at midnight, arrived at Seathwaite and then set off on their walk at 4am. They had made the summit of Scafell Pike but then found themselves in Upper Eskdale; cold, wet and concerned for their safety. They were not equipped properly for full winter conditions on the high fells, and were also inexperienced. At times they were waist deep in snow. To their credit, they fully acknowledged their misjudgment in this attempt and were humble and thankful for the help, fully aware this could have ended with a much worse outcome.

A ‘three peaks’ walking party of three had become separated after setting off from the valley at 8pm. The group of two were reporting themselves lost and thoroughly soaked, their waterproofs having succumbed to the heavy and prolonged rain. In addition, the other walker could now not be contacted and they were concerned for his safety. The Team Leader called the team out after considering the risks for all, also requesting support from Duddon and Furness MRT and Lake District Mountain Rescue Search Dogs. This gave sufficient resource for a search, especially for the uncontactable lone walker. From a conversation with the party of two, it was deemed most likely that they were at the head of Piers Gill and so teams headed up the valley to begin the ascent. It was considered too risky to attempt a ‘talk-off’ due to poor communications and their likely location. On arrival at Brackenclose there was some good news as the lone walker was located in the car park. He was taken care of and the extra resources of search dogs and Duddon and Furness MRT were able to be stood down. Team members made their way to Piers Gill and were able to locate the group of two in the expected place. They then safely negotiated challenging weather conditions and rising water levels on the descent to the valley. Again there are some lessons to learn and share, a few in particular to note here: Weather warnings will be more severe on the mountains. Team members reported some gusts risking blowing them off their feet. The mountain will be there another day. Navigation is always much more challenging in poor weather. Stick together as a group.

There was also a separate call for a lone walker that was directed initially to Keswick MRT with an initial location in their area. A full callout was made in case a stretcher carry became needed, and team members made their way to the location. Once on scene, after some additional clothing, calories and reassurance, a slow walk-off proved possible with some direct assistance from team members. It was established on the descent that the group of five walkers accounted for both alerts as the lone walker had met up with the group of four. The descent to Wasdale valley was completed without incident, and the group of five taken back to base for a debrief and to pick up a taxi. However, a taxi proved impossible to source on this occasion at 4am and so two team members unselfishly stayed with the group at base until one became available at 8am. Hopefully some lessons learned about not underestimating the high fells and having capable leaders established for any sub groups that split from a larger outing. Overall a good outcome on this occasion.

He was concerned for his safety. The initial location description was described as Lingmell Crag. A full callout was made, with a potentially serious and challenging crag rescue from the East side of Lingmell. However a subsequent accurate Phonefind put the walker on Goat Crags, and with a clear mobile phone reception, the Team Leader was able to direct the walker to the Lingmell Nose descent path. Fortunately the leg injury was not serious and the walker then made his own way safely off the fell, wet and cold, but otherwise OK. Team members who had been waiting at base were stood down having not been needed to deploy. A good outcome. ", Incident started at 20:58 and ended at 22:15 making 1.3 hrs in total.

A fell runner undertaking an organised long distance event had sustained a suspected ankle fracture. After some initial uncertainty on location it was confirmed that she was on the Burnmoor Tarn path, with Wasdale the quickest access point. The team was called out, with help received from Duddon and Furness MRT due to slightly low numbers required for a stretcher carry. A race paramedic was first on scene and made an assessment and gave initial pain relief. Once the team arrived, further assessment, pain relief and splinting took place, before packaging into the team stretcher. After the stretcher carry to Brackenclose, a handover was made to a land ambulance crew for subsequent transfer to hospital. Thanks to Duddon and Furness MRT once again.

Passing walkers had stopped to help. The team was called out and due to the time it would take for the team to reach the casualty Helimed support was also requested. In the meantime the casualty party was able to carefully make their way slowly to Lingmell Col. Helimed 58 from Langwathby duly responded but was diverted to a higher priority tasking. Then Helimed 08 from Blackpool was tasked, but again was called away. Unfortunately the weather was deteriorating so the stretcher evacuation then became the only remaining option. Numbers from Wasdale were a little low for a long carry, so support was requested from Duddon and Furness MRT, and this was quickly provided. However, when team members arrived on scene, the casualty’s condition had improved somewhat, and she very stoically decided that she would attempt to continue the descent on foot. With support from team members this proved possible and a slow walk was completed to Brackenclose, where a handover to a land ambulance crew took place. The team returned to base to reset the vehicles for the next callout. Thanks to both Helimed crews and to Duddon and Furness MRT for their willingness to support once again.
