Two climbers were ascending a crag on Sca Fell, when the lead climber took a large fall. He was seriously injured, unable to communicate and ended the fall suspended on the rope below the second climber. Fortunately, the second climber was uninjured and still secure on the crag, but urgently needed assistance.\nThe team was very quickly called out and help was requested from a Coastguard helicopter. Helimed 58 also responded quickly. As the team assembled at Brackenclose and prepared the large inventory of rope rescue, medical and other equipment required for a hugely challenging technical rescue, Rescue 199 arrived overhead. With the backup plan to uplift team members high on Sca Fell, saving significant time and effort for team members to get close to the scene, the crew of Rescue 199 took a close look at whether a winch rescue was possible. After some time carefully assessing the risks to all involved, an attempt to winch was made. We don\u2019t normally use superlatives, but with some truly amazing and heroic flying skills and teamwork, they managed to both access and then safely winch the climber directly into the helicopter from his suspended position on the end of the rope. A transfer to Helimed 58 was then completed to allow advanced medical care to be given, before then flying to a suitable hospital.\nWith the most urgent rescue completed by the helicopter crews, the rescue of the second climber still remained on what is one of the most inaccessible points of the Wasdale MR area. With the offer of further uplift assistance from Rescue 199 still a possibility (but not a guarantee), some members of the team set off on foot with heavy loads to the top of Sca Fell. However, after a refuel of the helicopter, the remaining ten team members were very grateful to get the lift up, comfortably overtaking the hill party. At this point, the technical rope rescue began, with several hundred metres of rope and countless other pieces of equipment assuring the safety of both team members and the climber. After some time, in very cold and windy conditions at height, the first rescuer was able to be lowered to the climber. She was able to very bravely and ably assist the rescue, doing most of the work herself to climb and scramble back to safe ground.\nAfter de-rigging, the long walk down to Brackenclose was completed safely and the climber re-united with awaiting family members. The team travelled back to base and spent considerable time checking equipment for damage and resetting the vehicles, before a debrief and finally being stood down to return home.\nOur thanks to both helicopter crews, and especially the crew of Rescue 199, whose actions brought the time down for the injured climber getting to definitive medical care by many hours.\nWe wish both climbers well and offer our very best wishes that the injured climber recovers fully from his injuries.

The group of two were reporting themselves lost and thoroughly soaked, their waterproofs having succumbed to the heavy and prolonged rain. In addition, the other walker could now not be contacted and they were concerned for his safety. The Team Leader called the team out after considering the risks for all, also requesting support from Duddon and Furness MRT and Lake District Mountain Rescue Search Dogs. This gave sufficient resource for a search, especially for the uncontactable lone walker.

It was considered too risky to attempt a \u2018talk-off\u2019 due to poor communications and their likely location. On arrival at Brackenclose there was some good news as the lone walker was located in the car park. He was taken care of and the extra resources of search dogs and Duddon and Furness MRT were able to be stood down. Team members made their way to Piers Gill and were able to locate the group of two in the expected place. They then safely negotiated challenging weather conditions and rising water levels on the descent to the valley. Again there are some lessons to learn and share, a few in particular to note here: Weather warnings will be more severe on the mountains. Team members reported some gusts risking blowing them off their feet. The mountain will be there another day. Navigation is always much more challenging in poor weather. Stick together as a group.

There was also a separate call for a lone walker that was directed initially to Keswick MRT with an initial location in their area. A full callout was made in case a stretcher carry became needed, and team members made their way to the location. Once on scene, after some additional clothing, calories and reassurance, a slow walk-off proved possible with some direct assistance from team members. It was established on the descent that the group of five walkers accounted for both alerts as the lone walker had met up with the group of four. The descent to Wasdale valley was completed without incident, and the group of five taken back to base for a debrief and to pick up a taxi.

A Father was reporting his son overdue from a walk up Scafell Pike. He had reached the summit successfully at 4pm, however no contact had been possible since. As it was not known which route had been taken, a search of all of the normal car parks was undertaken, with his car discovered at Seathwaite by Keswick MRT. Due to the winter conditions including heavy snowfall at height, lone walker and his inexperience, a full callout was made for a search. Support from Keswick MRT, Duddon and Furness MRT, RAF Leeming, RAF Valley and Coastguard helicopter was requested and received quickly. As teams started their allocated search routes, a further request was made for additional resources from other Lakes teams in the morning for contingency planning. Unfortunately a key search asset Coastguard helicopter Rescue 199 was unable to complete its requested search area of Piers Gill due to low cloud. As such, the Team Leader diverted two team members onto this route. Weather conditions of heavy snow and 6 to 12 inches of lying snow at height made search conditions difficult and hazardous, with some parties aborting search routes at higher elevations. At about 2am, shouts from rescuers were rewarded with a faint call back followed by a whistle. Unfortunately it was the party tasked with Piers Gill, with the walker\u2019s location at the bottom of the gill soon confirmed by searchlight and thermal imaging scope. He confirmed that he had broken his leg and couldn\u2019t move. His two dogs were located above a waterfall pitch from him, but both seemed fit and well (see part 2). With a technical rope rescue (likely) or helicopter winch (unlikely due to the location and conditions) now the two options, the Team Leader coordinated resources to attempt both. Rescue 936 from Caernarfon this time was tasked to help. Two team members from another search route returned to the team vehicles at Brackenclose to ready medical, stretcher and crag rescue equipment. Eight loads of equipment were required, with only two team members, so Rescue 936 agreed to uplift the rescuers and equipment as close as possible. The RAF MR teams were closest to the scene so were redirected, with a total of 13 rescuers. With the weather improving and cloud base lifting, Rescue 936 attempted to directly access the walker, but this was not possible. Then, having found a landing site at Middleboot Knotts, they returned to Brackenclose to pickup the two team members and equipment. The RAF teams collected the extra equipment from the landing site and returned to scene. Rescue 936 left the area to refuel. \nA team casualty carer was then lowered via a side gully into the bottom of the gill, with further rescuers and equipment following. It was quickly established that the walker had suffered serious injuries and was very cold, but thankfully he had managed to find a small shelf to keep himself mostly out of the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwater. Medical assessment and treatment was given and cold wet clothing exchanged for dry in a bivvy shelter. As quickly as possible in very challenging conditions a stretcher, casualty bag, heat blankets, vacuum mattress and dual rope system was also established, and then the walker was packaged securely. The haul out of the gill was completed to the awaiting team members.\n Rescue 936 then returned to scene and winched the casualty, before transferring swiftly to hospital for further assessment and treatment. After the remaining team members were retrieved from the gill, equipment was packed up and the teams walked wearily back to Brackenclose. Once back at base at about noon all team members enjoyed much needed food and refreshments kindly prepared by other members. All in all, a very challenging search and rescue in winter conditions. Once more, great teamwork and support from all teams. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d particularly like to thank the visiting RAF teams and Rescue 936 for their help on scene.

A lone male walker was reported overdue by a friend, having declared an intent to climb Scafell. He had left home early the previous morning, likely setting off on the fell at about 7:30am. The police had checked car parks and located his car at Brackenclose. Very limited additional information was known, other than he had intended to return the same day before the weather deteriorated (early afternoon). With team members recovering from the previous callout, coupled with the prospect of a major search on both Scafell and Scafell Pike, (walkers often talk about Scafell but really mean Scafell Pike) the Team Leader escalated the callout to regional level, requesting support from all other Lake District teams. The poor weather of the previous day made the search urgent due to risk of hypothermia. Visibility was still poor and the temperature was forecasted to drop further through the day. An initial Wasdale party set off at 04:42, and then other teams were tasked as they arrived at base, or remotely if that saved time. Search dogs and coastguard helicopter support was also received. As the digital map began to fill with many traces of individual rescuers, a shout was heard by the Cockermouth MRT team from the bottom of Piers Gill. The team were able to access the location with a rope system. Unfortunately the walker had suffered injuries to both ankles, amongst other injuries, and as such medical treatment and evacuation by stretcher was required. He had been in the gill injured for about 24 hours by this point having mis-navigated on his descent from the summit. Other teams on the hill then migrated to the evacuation point with further medical equipment. Specialist rope rescue equipment, stretcher, and further casualty packaging was flown from the valley with additional team members by Coastguard helicopter Rescue 199. Medical assessment and treatment was given in the gill before a technical rescue was then undertaken, led by the Cockermouth team and with assistance from all the other teams present. Having done the hard bit, the normally straightforward part of either a stretcher carry or helicopter transport from the scene proved difficult. With weather conditions thwarting a helicopter extraction, and steep ground below preventing a descent by stretcher, the safest and quickest option was an uphill carry to Lingmell Col. After an energy sapping journey, also helped by a passing Assynt MRT team member, the walker was transferred into the care of the awaiting Helimed 58 crew. He was then flown to hospital for further treatment. We wish the walker a quick recovery from his injuries. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to offer huge thanks to all supporting teams and agencies, including offers received later in the morning and not required.

The Team Leader made a full callout and also asked a team member in the valley to travel direct to help the informant off the hill and obtain further information. At this point she had almost made it back to Brackenclose. With lots of uncertainty, and the possibility of a search over a large area, Duddon and Furness MRT was asked to search the paths in Eskdale. Additionally two search dogs were given taskings. With 27 pairs of boots (and eight paws) on the ground in both valleys, the teams made their way uphill. After a couple of false alarms, a Wasdale hill party heard shouts from Piers Gill. On further careful investigation over the edge, a light was seen and soon it was confirmed that the walker was in a precarious position at the bottom of the gill. Fortunately he was able to stand and shout back to team members. All Wasdale parties converged and proceeded to set up rope access to enable team members to safely descend. Once on scene the walker was confirmed to have taken a few tumbles, and was soaking wet, but after some warming, food and extra clothing he was able to manage an assisted climb out of the gill. Once back on safe ground, he was further assessed and debriefed. He had suffered many abrasions from scrambling, slipping and sliding down treacherous ground on the descent in the gill. Due to this it was decided to take the longer but safer route back up to Lingmell Col before descending finally to Brackenclose. An ambulance was also requested as a precaution to further assess the walker. At Brackenclose, the two walkers were finally reunited, before being taken to hospital for a full assessment.

No contact was able to be made by mobile phone, so we did not have any real leads\u2122 as to which areas to search. Search teams were sent via the normal routes in Wasdale and Eskdale. The team sent to Sty Head were clearly barking up the wrong tree and found nothing. Other teams were poodling around for some time with nothing heard or seen. However, the search team in Hollow Stones heard a woof and a howl in response to their whistles, and so we finally had a Scooby Doo. The hunt was on. A light was seen high on the flanks of Scafell, but due to the mist it was very difficult to tell exactly where. Dogged determination kept the teams searching in Lord\u2019s Rake, up Black Crag and in Red Gill. Finally a clear line of sight could be made and fortunately the group was thankfully found to be dogfast rather than cragfast, on steep ground but manageable with care. Dexter, the 40kg Doberman/Belgian Malinois cross had decided not to move any further on nightfall, despite much encouragement. The walkers were uninjured, cold, and had not wanted to leave their dog on the fell. They were equipped well enough to spend an unplanned night on the fell, and we found that Dexter was trained to bark and howl, thus initially attracting our attention. Other rescuers harnessed the energy to make the hard pull up to their location but no amount of encouragement could make Dexter move downhill. The agreed course of action was to wait for daylight and hope that he regained his confidence to move downhill with better visibility. As such, bivvy shelters were deployed for all, and a long paws ensued. After a woof night, as dawn broke, further attempts were made but Dexter stood fast. As hope was fading a last ditch attempt was made with a 50m rope lead and he was gently encouraged downhill . Thankfully once he started moving there were no further problems and a brisk, boisterous and friendly walk with Dexter was then made back to Brackenclose. The team wearily were recalled to base and the vehicles were reset. A friendly team member had kindly played fetch with breakfast butties from the local shop.

Coastguard helicopter support was also agreed and deployed from Prestwick with Rescue 199. With different aircraft capability and technology on board they were able to get a visual and confirm exact location. Unfortunately they were also unable to directly help and provide a winch rescue due to the proximity of the crag face. The Rescue 199 crew then helped hugely by lifting three sets of team members to the closest location possible, from which they walked uphill to Red Gill. On arrival the walker was unfortunately located in the gully itself, very close to a 10m drop. As such, a technical rope rescue was required. The casualty was unable to move by himself, but was able to talk and had managed to wrap a survival blanket around him. As a technical and labour intensive rescue was now likely, additional team members from our friends at Duddon and Furness MRT was again requested. R199 again obliged and lifted four of their team members and additional rope and medical supplies from Devoke Water en-route to Wasdale. Other DFMRT members followed in team vehicles.

It was agreed that the walker would attempt to move himself slowly from the gully with support from the rope system and team members. This was able to be done and once off the more technical ground, a more straightforward descent with support was made to get to a location that was suitable for a helicopter winch.

After a humid walk up to the scene, team casualty carers assessed and treated the ankle, providing splinting and some strong pain relief. The walker was then secured into the stretcher for a carry down to flatter ground at Lingmell Col, where the helicopter was waiting for the transfer. The walker was then flown to hospital for further treatment and the team returned to the vehicles in the valley. We wish the walker well and hope to see her back on the fells soon. Thanks to the crew of Rescue 912 for their help, saving us a long carry to the valley floor. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  ", "rescue_info": " Incident started at 18:25 and ended at 00:55 making 6.5 hrs in total.

Eventually the Wasdale group found the casualty party of walkers (as it turned out, three!) in roughly the location expected.

Both parties were not adequately equipped in terms of navigation equipment or skills. Misty conditions do make navigation challenging, and especially so, high on the Scafell Massif.

Two fast team members, travelling very light with immediate first aid, warm clothing and a shelter were dispatched as there was concern that the casualty would already be very hypothermic. Back up parties followed with additional equipment. The lost walker was not found at the original location, and contact had been lost so a search of the area was mounted in exceptionally difficult conditions.

Having team members with their own pampered pooches at home and also our very own much adored search dog Jess, we recognise the distress that both an animal can feel and also that of their owners.  Therefore, last night when Cumbria Police contacted us about a St. Bernard dog (Daisy) who had collapsed whilst descending from the summit of Scafell Pike and therefore unable to carry on; our members didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2t need to think twice about mobilising and deploying to help retrieve Daisy off England\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s highest.

In advance of getting on location advice had been sought from several local vets regarding pain relief, possible issues specific to that breed of dog and how best to handle them in such stressful situations.  On reaching their location, team members carefully introduced themselves to Daisy so as not to cause any additional distress, and with the help of a treat or two members were able to assess her condition and administer analgesia for the pain.  A few different tactics needed to be tried until both Daisy and her stretcher bearers were all satisfied and progress down-hill could be made. It had become quickly apparent that Daisy\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s cooperation was going to be essential if we were to make progress as Daisy made sure we knew that if she didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2t want to do something, she wasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2t going to do it. However, after a little persuasion and a bit of arranging the stretcher to become dog friendly and of course plenty more treats, the 55kg Daisy very quickly settled down with her chin resting on the head guard, having realised that we were trying to help her.

She apparently feels a bit guilty and slightly embarrassed about letting down the image of her cousins bouncing across the Alpine snows with barrels of brandy around their necks.

During the county wide flooding in early December the west of the county was fortunately less badly affected and the Wasdale team took on the role of helping to coordinate the response elsewhere as well as providing a \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00cb\u0153Type C\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 team of swiftwater rescue technicians. This article presents an overview of the events between Sat 5th \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Sun 7th December. Early on Saturday morning it was apparent that it had rained hard for a long time and was likely to do so for a lot longer. The morning teleconferences started to conclude that a major flood incident was likely and soon tasks were coming in, particularly around Keswick and Kendal. Around lunchtime Keswick were dealing with a large number of jobs and support was sent from Cockermouth, Wasdale and Duddon teams. Kendal also started to get busy and a second Duddon team went over to support there. Langdale \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ambleside were tasked to help rescue people from a bus trapped by landslides on the A591. At this point it started to become apparent that the incident would go on for a long time in many different places and if the MR effort was to keep pace further support was needed. Calls went out to the other regions to ask what help they might be able to offer ? Later on Saturday evening Cockermouth started to flood as well and the main street became a river once again. There was now activity in every MR base in Cumbria, except for Patterdale, which was flooded. Despite the west of Cumbria being relatively unaffected there was a 6 strong team in the Wasdale base helping to keep an overview of events elsewhere. Operations continued through the night around the county. On Sunday the focus started to shift to Carlisle. The out of county teams were important to the MR effort in Carlisle as many of the local teams were busy in their own areas. During the Sunday groups from the Peak District, Calder Valley, Ogwen / North Wales, Swaledale, Upper Wharfdale, Kirkby Stephen, Coniston, Penrith and Wasdale teams were all deployed in Carlisle. Bowland Pennine and CRO also supported in the south of the county. Away from Carlisle operations were still ongoing in Cockermouth and Kendal and new fronts started to open up. Penrith had a number of incidents in Eamont Bridge. Kirkby Stephen were called to help with evacuations in Appleby. Patterdale, now displaced from their base, supported this effort and also helped with the rescue of an Ullswater steamer that broke free from its moorings. Duddon team helped to move Kidney Dialysis patients in the south of the county. Operations continued through Sunday night but by now it was apparent that the pace had to slow, not just because the swiftwater teams were tired but it was also becoming difficult to man the various supporting roles in the bases. Into Monday and there was still flooding in Carlisle and the east of the county but the water was starting to go down slowly elsewhere. The effort continued in Carlisle with mainly local teams from Duddon, Penrith and Wasdale along with the second team to come up from Ogwen. It was known earlier in the weekend that things were difficult in Patterdale but the picture that started to emerge through the day was a community without power, water or telephone links and had been cut off for 2 days due to collapse of Pooley Bridge. The Patterdale team started to get back into the village and with their limited communications provide a picture of the conditions down the valley. By the evening the flood waters had receded in most places and it was only in Patterdale that MR operations continued. ", "rescue_info": " Incident started at 07:00.

Further to this, the current weather forecast is predicated to get rather cold over the weekend with snow on the hills, winter is still in mountains and you should go prepared with a torch, plenty of warm and waterproof clothing and a map / compass.\nPlease take note of the learning above and understand if you are going to comment on the above that you do not have the whole picture of the groups situation at the time of these events.

It is worth noting that whilst the party of two were being readied for the walk back down, another two walkers appeared out of the darkness along with a further three, all looking for assistance.  The two rescuers were now accompanying a largish group of seven walkers which was further swollen when the other team members made contact..

When nothing was seen they called out the team via the Police. Following a major search involving over 40 team members from Wasdale, Keswick, Duddon & Furness, and 4 SARDA search dogs, the family were located just after midnight in the bottom of Piers Gill at the bend by the waterfall pitches (the same location as incident 12a). Although tired, cold and wet the family were well equipped and out of the wind and driving rain. Conditions on the mountain were severe with low cloud, visibility down to 30 feet, strong winds and driving rain. The family were brought out of the Gill and due to the cold and wet and tiredness, the 5 year old son was brought down by stretcher.

The break has healed on its own with no need for surgery that was discussed at length in the days that followed The number you were given by the police was in fact, uselessly, mine. but as I was out of any signal range walking down the corridor route I never got the calls till back in the hospital that night. The subsequent call to chastise me received a few days later left no number and was from an unobptainable number so I could not reply and set the record right. I have just seen the entry on the web page and thought I ought to put the record straight. I was as you say in the report unaware throughout that you were looking for me and had indeed refused help on the way down from other walkers most of which were very keen to get the helicopter out ( i guess out of concern and the spectacle it would have caused) I organise the charity event that i was part of and take H&S very seriously, we have risk assessments of all our events, clear processes and plans for emergencies and injuries and a support team throughout including first aiders and first aid equipment with us on the walks. I got the distinct impression from the comments left on my phone and in this report that i in some wasted your time and was not worthy of your attention on that day. hopefully the injuries that i did sustain will go someway in correcting the view. I am self sufficient by nature and was not keen on making a fuss however although I personally did not call you out I still feel that the those that did, made a good call based on the facts they had before them at the top of Scafell Pike. The final point was that the facts they gave the police were that the number given was mine, they gave the number of those in our party the time we left the summit our direction and route. the police seemed comfortable that this was exactly what you needed to mount the correct level of support at the time.. they also agreed that as it was freezing cold and blowing a gale at the top that if I could walk it would be best to do so. Clearly not interested in entering some great debate on this, merely to set the record straight as I will be up there again next year with a group, yep not put off despite everything!! despite all of this I would like to donate money to the mountain rescue as the role you all perform is tremendous and worthy. Not sure how much would be useful for you so it would be great if you could give me a call to see what we could arrange Could you please let me know how i do this and if you have the time please give me a call on my mobile ", "rescue_info": " Incident started at 11:07.

The cancellation bleep was put out and the informant was contacted by phone.He now said the casualty was just above the bridge (approx. 400m from vehicles).  He was asked if the casualty needed medical attention and indeed whether he ever had.  The informant said they would assess him when he gotto the vehicles and would take him to hospital themselves if that proved necessary.

From what the informant could tell it was found difficult to determine whether the casualty had indeed suffered a genuine injury (which the team would always respond to) or whether the injury was actually better classified as a knee strain.  Either way, as a general point, it helps prioritize the right levels of response and back up required if  informants give more detail when requesting MR assistance.  e.g. location and injury and what sort of event caused it].Post event note \u2013 the walker had a knee injury when he had done Ben Nevis previously that day and this was the other knee which was a coruscate ligament failure- he had to be fireman carried back down so well done to the person who did the carrying but they would probably have been better staying put and getting him down on a stretcher.

The incident was closed down by mid afternoon.   At the time of writing this report his condition is unknown. [now understood to have been a heart attack].   The Great North Air Ambulance press release is included below. Team members treat the casualty Pride of Cumbria undertakes its 100th MissionThe \u201cPride of Cumbria\u201d took to the sky on Sunday to complete its 100th mission to date.  The aircraft was activated by the Police when Keswick MRT requested assistance to help a man who had collapsed on Green Gable. Members of the Wasdale MRT were already on scene. The Pride of Cumbria flew up Green Gable but was unable to reach the summit due to the low cloud base. The helicopter then returned to Seathwaite where members of the Keswick Mountain Rescue Team were airlifted to Sty Head Tarn by the helicopter. The mountain rescue team then had to climb a further 1000ft to reach the casualty where he was being treated for exposure. The Mountain Rescue Team then stretchered the patient on the 45 minute descent down Green Gable to Sty Head Tarn where the patient was given further treatment by the Air Ambulance Paramedic before being flown to the Cumberland Infirmary at Carlisle.Paramedic Jon Ker on board the Cumbria aircraft said \u201d The Mountain Rescue Teams did a fantastic job and it was brilliant being able to assist the Mountain Rescue Teams to rescue this gentleman off Green Gable and then to airlift him to hospital in a very short time. It was excellent being able to work in partnership with the Mountain Rescue Teams.\u201d  ", "rescue_info": " Incident started at 11:45.

The team leader and a friend were out for a scramble on Scafell when they came across a 70 year old man on the Foxes Tarn descent route.  The man from Lancashire, had been dropped off at Boot, Eskdale by his wife and was heading for the Band on Bowfell to be picked up again at Old Dungeon Gill, Langdale.  He had taken a fall but was alright and was slowly making his way down.  Noting the lateness of the day, that he was moving slowly and that he did not have a light the Team Leader decided to walk down to Sampson\u2019s Stones with him (Upper Eskdale), lend him a torch and see him safely on his way across to Three Tarns.When the Team Leader got home he called the leader of the Langdale Ambleside team to advise that the guy would be making his way down in the dark but was fine.  If there were calls made to the police for whatever reason then at least he would know about the person and intended route.  Nothing further happened until early the next morning when the man\u2019s wife phoned the police to say she was worried about him being so overdue.  Shortly after the wife\u2019s call to the Police, the man phoned his wife on the mobile to say he was safely on his way down. He eventually got down safely the next day and called the Team leader to thank him for the loan of the torch and to explain the events of the previous day.He had made his way to Green Hole (at the top of Eskdale), worked his way up and into the crags and mist and lost his route.  Recognising that he would not get off the mountain that night, he descended to a safe area and phoned his wife to say that he would not be down to meet her that night but not to worry as he was happy to find a place to sleep in the shelter of the rocks.  At first light he started back up but was unable to call his wife on the mobile to reassure her due to no signal.  She had started to worry about his condition again in the morning when she had not heard from him so called the police.  He called her as soon as he got a signal and then made his way down the Band.  A story with a happy ending. He was well equipped ( apart from having to borrow a torch from the Wasdale Team Leader) and is a good example of how some walkers are quite hardy when it comes to looking after themselves, even at the grand age of 70!Thanks for the story Julian.

The cloud was down so a helicopter evacuation was not possible.The poor visibility made locating the casualty extremely difficult and it progressed into a major search.  Langdale and Ambleside team were asked in to help who also involved Kendal team.  There were also a number a search dogs deployed.  In all there were probably 50 team members on the hill.  The casualty was found at around midnight, high up on the Eskdale side of Crinkle Crags, a long way off the path in Rusty Gill.  He had sustained a nasty gash to his head but had remained conscious.  He could not walk and was laying in the bottom of the very steep sided gill. He was extremely cold and wet after his ordeal in the gill but had warmed up quickly once in the casualty bag.  He was manually lifted out of the gill (he was a heavy man at 16 stone) and carried some 300 metres along the side of the crag on very steep and unstable ground.  In many areas the stretcher had to be manhandled between team members, hand over hand, which is a very slow process.  At around 0130 hrs he was safely down off the crags but there was still a long carry out to Cockley Beck via Mosedale.  A request for RAF helicopter assistance had been made on two occasions through the night but due to the very poor weather and imminent bad weather front, the crews were unable to assist.All the team vehicles were sent round the Cockley Beck ( bottom of Hardknott Pass on the Wrynose side) and there were some 12 team vehicles there when the stretcher party arrived.  This included the Langdale Ambleside ambulance which was possibly going to be used to convey the casualty back over Hardknott Pass to the waiting ambulance at Brotherilkeld telephone box.

It is still in the middle of nowhere at the bottom of Hard Knott and is vital for reporting accidents quickly.  It was used when the RAF helicopter crashed in 1991 to sort out logistics and is used regularly to report road traffic accidents.

The injured person who was a local man, had tried text messaging SOS with accurate details of his location to \u2018999\u2019 but he was laying in an area of weak signal.  The passing walker took his phone to a higher position on the mountain to get the signal and raise the alarm.  Interestingly, if you look at the photograph of where the accident happened you will be surprised that there was no signal.  The casualty had set off that day to walk Yewbarrow and then on around the tops.  When he got to the second summit of Yewbarrow he saw black storm clouds in the distance so wisely retraced his steps back down to the valley.  Rather than just return to the car park he decided to drop down to the lower path which runs alongside the beck.  He had only descended 10 metres down the wet grassy slopes when he slipped and fractured his leg.The injured leg was immobilized in an inflatable splint and after suitable anesthesia, the casualty was carried down to Overbeck to be taken to West Cumberland Hospital by ambulance.  Photos taken on scene give a good appreciation of the numbers of team members required to effect a rescue of this nature, relatively close to the road.  The incident was close at around 1730 hrs.  The walker had sustained a nasty double fracture of his lower right leg which required steel pinning.

Also the marshall for Scafell Pike failed to reach that checkpoint) and the Bowland teams bivvy area contained all their kit including the remains of their breakfast cooking. We collected all the competitors tags which had been dumped in a heap to pass on to the race organiser. Then we bundled up the kit and weighted it down with more stones.

The group used the Mickledore stretcher to move the casualty out from the crag and he was subsequently picked up by RAF Helicopter from Leconfield and flown to Carlisle hospital. There were 13 other Team members on the fell who would have been needed had the helicopter not been successful in carrying out the lift. An RAF MRT who were climbing in Borrowdale at the time of the incident also attended to provide support if required. Many thanks to Peter and his colleagues from the Welsh team.

The group consisted of two adults (in their thirties) and two girls (aged 14 and 16). There was little information regarding their experience or the equipment they might be carrying but their wives had given an intended route which would have taken them from Seathwaite, up Scafell Pike and then back to Seatoller via Glaramara and Thornythwaite Fell. The whole group were staying in a guest house in Ambleside. As much of their intended route (including their start and finish) would be within the Keswick MRT area, the team leader passed the details over to the Keswick MRT, Team Leader and the two Team Leaders jointly worked on the incident from there on. Keswick were able to confirm that the missing person\u2019s vehicle was indeed still parked near Seathwaite and they spoke to the wives, to see if they could get any more useful information before we commenced a search for them. Full call outs of Keswick and Wasdale MRTs were initiated at 0120 hrs and the one remaining search dog handler left in the Lake District (while all the rest were away training in Scotland) was also called in to assist. The two teams jointly covered all the major routes around Scafell Pike and the ridge over to Glaramara and eventually located the missing walkers in Eskdale at around 0700 hrs. They had made a navigational error and become lost. They were tired and cold but otherwise unhurt and were therefore assisted to walk off the mountain, before being given a lift back to where they were staying in Ambleside. Conditions on the summits were quite cold and windy and low cloud was causing very poor visibility, particularly during the night. All parties were re-called off the hill and returned to base by around 0930 hrs, 2001-08-21.Rescue postscript: The team leader subsequently spoke to the deputy team leader, who\u2019s group were the ones that found the four missing walkers. It seems they stayed on their intended route up to the summit of Scafell Pike but that they then went to Mickledore and descended into Upper Eskdale via the side of the Cam Spout waterfall. From there, they attempted to find Esk Hause, to continue over Glaramara but got lost somewhere. We think they spent the night sheltering in a small sheep fold somewhere on the south side of the Esk/Cam Spout area and on the flanks of Esk Pike. They were not very experienced walkers and had not been well equipped to cope with the enforced bivi. It was perhaps fortunate that they found shelter relatively low down and out of the wind as the tops would have been much more unpleasant. The search dog handler from Ambleside gave them all a lift back from Eskdale, in his car. They did not report hearing any shouts or seeing lights of rescuers.

He had been walking alone when the accident happened and had been lying injured for about half an hour before his shouts for help had luckily been heard by other passing walkers. Because of strong winds and difficult flying conditions at the scene, we had to carry the injured man to the nearest point the helicopter could land on. This was about a kilometre away but around 200m up hill ! The helicopter, from RAF Boulmer transferred him to West Cumberland Hospital and the Team returned to base by about 1730 hrs.

They had received a 999 call from two lads (18 and 19 yr old) who reported being stuck on steep ground on the West side of Yewbarrow.

Further telephone conversations managed to glean enough information to suggest they were on the side of Kirkfell, yet another different mountain !! We finally managed to sight them not far down from the summit of Kirkfell and got to them at about 8.30pm. They were simply frightened to continue without assistance and were on steep loose scree. We put them in helmets and harnesses and assisted them to walk down. Very slow going, with us getting back to Wasdale Head at 10.30pm. The moral of the story : we are seeing an increasing trend that when people use their mobile phones to summon assistance, a lot of them don\u2019t actually know where they are!

Weather at the scene was cold, windy and extremely wet, and they were in thick cloud. There were a total of seven adults at the casualty site and a further seven members from the group were descending towards Wasdale Head. We found the group near the top of Piers Ghyll and worked on re-warming the casualty for about an hour, before carrying him on a stretcher down to a point on Lingmel Nose, where an RAF helicopter could get in to lift him to safety. He was flown to West Cumberland Hospital, where he made a full recovery.

Due to the high winds, rain and low cloud, the helicopter had some difficulty getting near the casualty\u2019s location (at Piers Gill).

Three women (aged between 35 and 45) had used a mobile phone to call 999 for assistance. They reported that they had lost the path in thick mist and were lost, probably somewhere between Broad Crag and Scafell Pike. They were apparently well equipped but were worried about how they would get back to a mini bus (and husband) at the Old Dungeon Ghyll, Langdale. The Police had advised them to stay put until they were contacted by the MRT. Julian Carradice, WMRT Team Leader tried to contact them but could only get an answer phone service (a common problem !!!) Without any further information he told the Police that he would not immediately turn the Team out. He would only initiate a call out if he believed there was a reasonable likelihood that people were at risk. He guessed that they were not far off the path and that once people started to walk along what is a main route to Scafell Pike, they would probably be able to contact somebody who would be in a position to assist them navigate. Julian kept trying to contact them every 10 to 15 minutes and eventually got through at about 10.30 am. During his conversation with them, he got them to get their compass and map out and to tell him in what direction certain features lay, relative to their position. e.g.. they could see Sellafield, they could see a valley to their north (Wasdale) and they could see crags in front of them, to their west (crags above Piers Ghyll/corridor route). Julian told them to walk south east for no more than two hundred meters until they came across the path on Broad Crag. (They had been going from Langdale and were still heading for the summit of the Pike when they got off route) Julian rang them again after 10 to 15 minutes and confirmed that they had regained the path.

As the hasty search was expanding, with team members searching routes all over the Scafell Massif, a 999 text message was received by Cumbria Police from two wild campers in Upper Eskdale. This indicated the name and location of the missing walker. With this excellent news, a nearby Duddon and Furness MRT search team arrived quickly, establishing that the walker had sustained minor injuries only. Rescue 199 also diverted quickly to the location and was on the ground at that location within 15 minutes of the text arriving. The walker was then flown to Brackenclose to be reunited with his very relieved and grateful family. All teams stood down and returned to their respective bases and homes.
