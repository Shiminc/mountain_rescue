We finally managed to sight them not far down from the summit of Kirkfell and got to them at about 8.30pm. They were simply frightened to continue without assistance and were on steep loose scree. We put them in helmets and harnesses and assisted them to walk down. Very slow going, with us getting back to Wasdale Head at 10.30pm. The moral of the story : we are seeing an increasing trend that when people use their mobile phones to summon assistance, a lot of them don\u2019t actually know where they are! We can cope better if those people admit to being lost, rather than give us what appears to confident information on their location, only for us to find that they\u2019re on a different mountain.

They had received a 999 call from someone (with a mobile phone), reporting that a 44 yr old man had collapsed with hypothermia, somewhere between Broad Crag and the summit of Scafell Pike. As the Team was en route to Wasdale, further conversations with the informant advised that the casualty had now become unconscious and that he was very cold. Weather at the scene was cold, windy and extremely wet, and they were in thick cloud. There were a total of seven adults at the casualty site and a further seven members from the group were descending towards Wasdale Head. We found the group near the top of Piers Ghyll and worked on re-warming the casualty for about an hour, before carrying him on a stretcher down to a point on Lingmel Nose, where an RAF helicopter could get in to lift him to safety. He was flown to West Cumberland Hospital, where he made a full recovery. (Although he did make a quick recovery, he had been unresponsive prior to the Team arriving and had got so cold that he\u2019d stopped shivering \u2013 i.e.: a sign that his body core temperature was below 30 degrees C. He certainly required assistance !!) As well as being warmed, he was treated with oxygen and his condition was monitored with the Propac. We also had a portable Automatic External Defibrillator with us, just in case he\u2019d gone into Ventricular Fibulation. Due to the high winds, rain and low cloud, the helicopter had some difficulty getting near the casualty\u2019s location (at Piers Gill). They were only able to get in to the pick up point during a break in the clouds and had to get him on board as quickly as possible. One of our team members twisted his ankle on the way down and we did think we might have to also carry him off. However, to all our relief, he managed to walk down under his own steam.

They had waterproof clothing with them, torches, map and compass and a rope and even had a radio, although no contact could be made. The Wasdale Team Leader decided to wait until 2300 hrs before asking Search Dogs etc to go and look for them and expected that they had simply made a navigational error, probably going down on the Eskdale side of the fell.

They had indeed made a navigational error and had eventually been assisted onto the correct route down by other 3 peaks participants.

Three women (aged between 35 and 45) had used a mobile phone to call 999 for assistance. They reported that they had lost the path in thick mist and were lost, probably somewhere between Broad Crag and Scafell Pike. They were apparently well equipped but were worried about how they would get back to a mini bus (and husband) at the Old Dungeon Ghyll, Langdale. The Police had advised them to stay put until they were contacted by the MRT. Julian Carradice, WMRT Team Leader tried to contact them but could only get an answer phone service (a common problem !!!) Without any further information he told the Police that he would not immediately turn the Team out. He would only initiate a call out if he believed there was a reasonable likelihood that people were at risk. He guessed that they were not far off the path and that once people started to walk along what is a main route to Scafell Pike, they would probably be able to contact somebody who would be in a position to assist them navigate. Julian kept trying to contact them every 10 to 15 minutes and eventually got through at about 10.30 am. During his conversation with them, he got them to get their compass and map out and to tell him in what direction certain features lay, relative to their position. e.g.. they could see Sellafield, they could see a valley to their north (Wasdale) and they could see crags in front of them, to their west (crags above Piers Ghyll/corridor route). Julian told them to walk south east for no more than two hundred meters until they came across the path on Broad Crag. (They had been going from Langdale and were still heading for the summit of the Pike when they got off route) Julian rang them again after 10 to 15 minutes and confirmed that they had regained the path. He then convinced them to head back towards Langdale and that they would warm up as they did this (they had been out since 05.30 am and were very cold and wet.) Julian had further contact with them on two more occasions until he knew they were safely back at Esk Hause. At this point the three ladies were now much happier and knew where they were going.
