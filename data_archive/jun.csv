0,0,Scafell – Mon 24th Mar 2025,2025-03-24,26 in 2025,Full Callout — Injured & Medical,Scafell,"['Clear', 'Cold', 'Dry']","['Air Ambulance', 'Coastguard', 'Cumbria Police', 'Helimed 58', 'Rescue 199 from Prestwick']",Multiple Injuries,Full Callout,Injured & Medical,https://www.wmrt.org.uk/incidents/scafell-mon-24th-mar-2025/,"The team was called out on Monday afternoon by Cumbria Police about a serious incident involving a fallen climber. Two climbers were ascending a crag on Sca Fell, when the lead climber took a large fall. He was seriously injured, unable to communicate and ended the fall suspended on the rope below the second climber. Fortunately, the second climber was uninjured and still secure on the crag, but urgently needed assistance.
The team was very quickly called out and help was requested from a Coastguard helicopter. Helimed 58 also responded quickly. As the team assembled at Brackenclose and prepared the large inventory of rope rescue, medical and other equipment required for a hugely challenging technical rescue, Rescue 199 arrived overhead. With the backup plan to uplift team members high on Sca Fell, saving significant time and effort for team members to get close to the scene, the crew of Rescue 199 took a close look at whether a winch rescue was possible. After some time carefully assessing the risks to all involved, an attempt to winch was made. We don’t normally use superlatives, but with some truly amazing and heroic flying skills and teamwork, they managed to both access and then safely winch the climber directly into the helicopter from his suspended position on the end of the rope. A transfer to Helimed 58 was then completed to allow advanced medical care to be given, before then flying to a suitable hospital.
With the most urgent rescue completed by the helicopter crews, the rescue of the second climber still remained on what is one of the most inaccessible points of the Wasdale MR area. With the offer of further uplift assistance from Rescue 199 still a possibility (but not a guarantee), some members of the team set off on foot with heavy loads to the top of Sca Fell. However, after a refuel of the helicopter, the remaining ten team members were very grateful to get the lift up, comfortably overtaking the hill party. At this point, the technical rope rescue began, with several hundred metres of rope and countless other pieces of equipment assuring the safety of both team members and the climber. After some time, in very cold and windy conditions at height, the first rescuer was able to be lowered to the climber. She was able to very bravely and ably assist the rescue, doing most of the work herself to climb and scramble back to safe ground.
After de-rigging, the long walk down to Brackenclose was completed safely and the climber re-united with awaiting family members. The team travelled back to base and spent considerable time checking equipment for damage and resetting the vehicles, before a debrief and finally being stood down to return home.
Our thanks to both helicopter crews, and especially the crew of Rescue 199, whose actions brought the time down for the injured climber getting to definitive medical care by many hours.
We wish both climbers well and offer our very best wishes that the injured climber recovers fully from his injuries. ", Incident started at 14:55 and ended at 01:49 making 10.9 hrs in total.

Further information received via another message indicated that one person was also ill, and another had injured his ankle. They had misnavigated off Scafell Pike summit, attempting to return to Seathwaite. The Team Leader swiftly made a full callout and asked an advance party of two to make their way as quickly as possible to the location. A Coastguard helicopter from Prestwick (Rescue 199) also responded quickly. The assumption at this stage was that the walkers had been lost since the previous afternoon. Further iPhone emergency messages indicated the party was moving down the valley towards the road, although for a time it was unclear whether this was the whole group or just one or two people. Thankfully the advance party had not travelled too far when they met up with the party of five walking out. All were safe and able to complete the journey to the road and then to a local hostelry, where they could organise a taxi back to Borrowdale. The debrief ascertained that the group had set off from North Yorkshire at midnight, arrived at Seathwaite and then set off on their walk at 4am. They had made the summit of Scafell Pike but then found themselves in Upper Eskdale; cold, wet and concerned for their safety. They were not equipped properly for full winter conditions on the high fells, and were also inexperienced. At times they were waist deep in snow. To their credit, they fully acknowledged their misjudgment in this attempt and were humble and thankful for the help, fully aware this could have ended with a much worse outcome.

In addition, the other walker could now not be contacted and they were concerned for his safety. The Team Leader called the team out after considering the risks for all, also requesting support from Duddon and Furness MRT and Lake District Mountain Rescue Search Dogs.

From a conversation with the party of two, it was deemed most likely that they were at the head of Piers Gill and so teams headed up the valley to begin the ascent. It was considered too risky to attempt a ‘talk-off’ due to poor communications and their likely location. On arrival at Brackenclose there was some good news as the lone walker was located in the car park. He was taken care of and the extra resources of search dogs and Duddon and Furness MRT were able to be stood down. Team members made their way to Piers Gill and were able to locate the group of two in the expected place.

There was also a separate call for a lone walker that was directed initially to Keswick MRT with an initial location in their area. A full callout was made in case a stretcher carry became needed, and team members made their way to the location. Once on scene, after some additional clothing, calories and reassurance, a slow walk-off proved possible with some direct assistance from team members. It was established on the descent that the group of five walkers accounted for both alerts as the lone walker had met up with the group of four. The descent to Wasdale valley was completed without incident, and the group of five taken back to base for a debrief and to pick up a taxi. However, a taxi proved impossible to source on this occasion at 4am and so two team members unselfishly stayed with the group at base until one became available at 8am.

Fog… a pilot’s worst nightmare! 


When flying and landing in Cumbria’s mountainous landscape, conditions can change in the blink of an eye, especially at high altitudes.


Our pilots constantly monitor the weather conditions to ensure the safety of our team, but on Saturday, while attending a call-out on Scafell Pike, a dense cloud of fog surrounded our aircraft without warning.


We’re unable to fly in these conditions because of poor visibility and the increased likelihood of icing, which we cannot fly in due to strict guidelines from the Civil Aviation Authority – the safety of our patients, crew, and equipment is paramount in these situations.


Thankfully, the team was still able to treat the patient we flew out to, and they accompanied them in the descent down the mountain alongside Wasdale Mountain Rescue Team and Duddon and Furness Mountain Rescue Team, but pilot Mik stayed with the aircraft to wait until a break in the clouds appeared.


That break didn’t come until Monday afternoon, meaning our helicopter was at the top of Scafell Pike for two days, as the weather conditions did not allow for us to take off safely. Thankfully, Mik was safely accompanied down the mountain on Sunday.


We’re delighted to say that The Pride of Cumbria II was brought back home safe and sound thanks to pilot Stu, who made the three-hour ascent on Monday morning.


Our teams were still on call responding to incidents via our rapid response vehicles and second helicopter, ensuring people in need across Cumbria still had access to our expert doctor and critical care paramedics.


Huge thanks to everyone who helped us get out of this pickle, including the mountain rescue teams, Cumbria Police and Multiflight. Sometimes, it’s not what happens, it’s how you respond to the situation that matters most.

As it was not known which route had been taken, a search of all of the normal car parks was undertaken, with his car discovered at Seathwaite by Keswick MRT. Due to the winter conditions including heavy snowfall at height, lone walker and his inexperience, a full callout was made for a search. Support from Keswick MRT, Duddon and Furness MRT, RAF Leeming, RAF Valley and Coastguard helicopter was requested and received quickly. As teams started their allocated search routes, a further request was made for additional resources from other Lakes teams in the morning for contingency planning. Unfortunately a key search asset Coastguard helicopter Rescue 199 was unable to complete its requested search area of Piers Gill due to low cloud. As such, the Team Leader diverted two team members onto this route. Weather conditions of heavy snow and 6 to 12 inches of lying snow at height made search conditions difficult and hazardous, with some parties aborting search routes at higher elevations. At about 2am, shouts from rescuers were rewarded with a faint call back followed by a whistle. Unfortunately it was the party tasked with Piers Gill, with the walker’s location at the bottom of the gill soon confirmed by searchlight and thermal imaging scope. He confirmed that he had broken his leg and couldn’t move. His two dogs were located above a waterfall pitch from him, but both seemed fit and well (see part 2). With a technical rope rescue (likely) or helicopter winch (unlikely due to the location and conditions) now the two options, the Team Leader coordinated resources to attempt both. Rescue 936 from Caernarfon this time was tasked to help. Two team members from another search route returned to the team vehicles at Brackenclose to ready medical, stretcher and crag rescue equipment. Eight loads of equipment were required, with only two team members, so Rescue 936 agreed to uplift the rescuers and equipment as close as possible. The RAF MR teams were closest to the scene so were redirected, with a total of 13 rescuers. With the weather improving and cloud base lifting, Rescue 936 attempted to directly access the walker, but this was not possible. Then, having found a landing site at Middleboot Knotts, they returned to Brackenclose to pickup the two team members and equipment. The RAF teams collected the extra equipment from the landing site and returned to scene. Rescue 936 left the area to refuel. 
A team casualty carer was then lowered via a side gully into the bottom of the gill, with further rescuers and equipment following. It was quickly established that the walker had suffered serious injuries and was very cold, but thankfully he had managed to find a small shelf to keep himself mostly out of the



























water. Medical assessment and treatment was given and cold wet clothing exchanged for dry in a bivvy shelter. As quickly as possible in very challenging conditions a stretcher, casualty bag, heat blankets, vacuum mattress and dual rope system was also established, and then the walker was packaged securely. The haul out of the gill was completed to the awaiting team members.
 Rescue 936 then returned to scene and winched the casualty, before transferring swiftly to hospital for further assessment and treatment. After the remaining team members were retrieved from the gill, equipment was packed up and the teams walked wearily back to Brackenclose. Once back at base at about noon all team members enjoyed much needed food and refreshments kindly prepared by other members. All in all, a very challenging search and rescue in winter conditions. Once more, great teamwork and support from all teams. Weâ€™d particularly like to thank the visiting RAF teams and Rescue 936 for their help on scene. We wish the walker all the best and hope he recovers quickly and fully from his injuries. 
All that remained was to rescue the walkerâ€™s two dogs. Additional team members with support from Duddon and Furness MRT had been obtained in the background with fresh legs ascending whilst tired ones came downâ€¦

Part 2 – Dog rescue:


Team members from Duddon and Furness MRT and Wasdale volunteered to rescue the walkerâ€™s two dogs. They were cragfast and unable to reach their owner below.


As the â€˜nightshiftâ€™ clocked off and returned to base, the relief dayshift was heading up the fell.


Once on scene, ropes were again used to keep team members safe whilst descending steep snowy ground to locate the dogs. They were encouraged gently with the lure of hotdogs back up the hill to safety and then back to base to be reunited later with family members.



It would be fabulous to help Duddon and Furness MRT raise much needed funds for their new base; they were instrumental in this doggy rescue and countless others on our patch over the years when we need support.

A lone male walker was reported overdue by a friend, having declared an intent to climb Scafell. He had left home early the previous morning, likely setting off on the fell at about 7:30am. The police had checked car parks and located his car at Brackenclose. Very limited additional information was known, other than he had intended to return the same day before the weather deteriorated (early afternoon). With team members recovering from the previous callout, coupled with the prospect of a major search on both Scafell and Scafell Pike, (walkers often talk about Scafell but really mean Scafell Pike) the Team Leader escalated the callout to regional level, requesting support from all other Lake District teams. The poor weather of the previous day made the search urgent due to risk of hypothermia. Visibility was still poor and the temperature was forecasted to drop further through the day. An initial Wasdale party set off at 04:42, and then other teams were tasked as they arrived at base, or remotely if that saved time. Search dogs and coastguard helicopter support was also received. As the digital map began to fill with many traces of individual rescuers, a shout was heard by the Cockermouth MRT team from the bottom of Piers Gill. The team were able to access the location with a rope system. Unfortunately the walker had suffered injuries to both ankles, amongst other injuries, and as such medical treatment and evacuation by stretcher was required. He had been in the gill injured for about 24 hours by this point having mis-navigated on his descent from the summit. Other teams on the hill then migrated to the evacuation point with further medical equipment. Specialist rope rescue equipment, stretcher, and further casualty packaging was flown from the valley with additional team members by Coastguard helicopter Rescue 199. Medical assessment and treatment was given in the gill before a technical rescue was then undertaken, led by the Cockermouth team and with assistance from all the other teams present. Having done the hard bit, the normally straightforward part of either a stretcher carry or helicopter transport from the scene proved difficult. With weather conditions thwarting a helicopter extraction, and steep ground below preventing a descent by stretcher, the safest and quickest option was an uphill carry to Lingmell Col. After an energy sapping journey, also helped by a passing Assynt MRT team member, the walker was transferred into the care of the awaiting Helimed 58 crew. He was then flown to hospital for further treatment. We wish the walker a quick recovery from his injuries. Weâ€™d like to offer huge thanks to all supporting teams and agencies, including offers received later in the morning and not required. This is an example of fantastic multiagency working (both voluntary and professional) to get the best possible outcome for the walker. As a team we are very thankful for the swift response to help.

In the first of two callouts in quick succession, a party of 4 young and inexperienced walkers reported themselves lost, wet, cold and concerned for their safety. They had seemingly mis-navigated in poor conditions off the summit and then lost the path.


The Team Leader directed them back to the summit from where a talk-off is possible, but one of the walkers was struggling to walk. As such a full callout was made for a potential stretcher carry. However, a further call was made from the party shortly afterwards with better news that they were back on a path and heading downhill in the right direction.


After this no further communication was possible to confirm location or progress. It was expected that team members ascending would meet the walkers coming down but this did not occur. With concern that another wrong turn had been made, in worsening conditions, further team members were requested and Duddon and Furness MRT called to search Upper Eskdale.


However as one of the additional team vehicles arrived at the car park at Brackenclose, the group were found at their vehicle having made their own way down. Somehow they had managed to accidentally avoid team members going up the fell. This was still very good news and all team members were recalled to base to warm up, refuel and overwhelm the drying room.

On further careful investigation over the edge, a light was seen and soon it was confirmed that the walker was in a precarious position at the bottom of the gill. Fortunately he was able to stand and shout back to team members. All Wasdale parties converged and proceeded to set up rope access to enable team members to safely descend. Once on scene the walker was confirmed to have taken a few tumbles, and was soaking wet, but after some warming, food and extra clothing he was able to manage an assisted climb out of the gill. Once back on safe ground, he was further assessed and debriefed. He had suffered many abrasions from scrambling, slipping and sliding down treacherous ground on the descent in the gill. Due to this it was decided to take the longer but safer route back up to Lingmell Col before descending finally to Brackenclose. An ambulance was also requested as a precaution to further assess the walker. At Brackenclose, the two walkers were finally reunited, before being taken to hospital for a full assessment.

Two walkers attempting to climb Scafell Pike had strayed into Upper Eskdale and reported themselves lost, cold and in need of help. Fortunately the police call was able to establish coordinates. Unfortunately the location was in a remote situation at the edge of our operational area. That meant a long wait for the pair as the team mobilised with a hasty party taking the shorter route from Wasdale, and others via Eskdale in case they walked downhill. Once the team were on scene, after some rewarming in a bivvy shelter and extra clothing they were able to walk back down to Wasdale where their car was located. Itâ€™s worth a reminder that mobile phone signal should not be relied upon in many parts of Wasdale and Eskdale.

Three people were reported to be stuck on steep and icy ground on Scafell. The coordinates from the police call confirmed that they were on Broad Stand, a black spot and very hazardous terrain for walkers, especially in winter conditions. This is a location for many serious incidents over the years. As we had team members on the fell and in the valley already they were able to retask, alongside additional team members volunteering with the new callout request. Duddon and Furness were asked to standby again. On the ascent it was established that one of the walkers had managed to ascend Broad Stand and was now safely off the fell, leaving two people to rescue. A Coastguard helicopter was requested and Rescue 199 duly attended. Unfortunately, patchy cloud and a light snow shower made conditions too dangerous to attempt a winch pick-off and so they returned to base, leaving a rope rescue to be undertaken. A â€˜spotterâ€™ team at Mickledore maintained communications with the party whilst safe rope access was established for two team members to descend. Once on scene, the walkers were given warm clothing, food, helmets, harnesses, spikes and plenty of reassurance. The ascent to the top of Broad Stand was successfully made before a further warm in a bivvy shelter. The long descent into the valley and back to the vehicles was then completed before transferring in a team vehicle to family in the Wasdale Head Inn. Thanks to the crew Rescue 199 and to Duddon and Furness MRT. We hope the walkers recover quickly from their predicament.

Fortunately two team members were already on the hill in different locations, but both agreed to change their plans and divert to assess the situation and see if they could help.
Once on scene, the walker was assessed and it was decided to attempt to walk slowly down to Wasdale Head. Fortunately this was possible and the two team members escorted the walker to the Wasdale Head Inn for some replenishment of calories, hydration and to arrange a taxi for onwards transport.

Cumbria Police alerted us to a report from a concerned family member. A group of two male walkers, plus a dog  (Dexter) had failed to make contact from an intended walk up Scafell Pike and were overdue. Due to the weather conditions, and real potential for hypothermia, a full callout was made and additional support gained from Duddon and Furness MRT and the Lake District search dogs. No contact was able to be made by mobile phone, so we did not have any real leads™ as to which areas to search. Search teams were sent via the normal routes in Wasdale and Eskdale. The team sent to Sty Head were clearly barking up the wrong tree and found nothing. Other teams were poodling around for some time with nothing heard or seen. However, the search team in Hollow Stones heard a woof and a howl in response to their whistles, and so we finally had a Scooby Doo. The hunt was on. A light was seen high on the flanks of Scafell, but due to the mist it was very difficult to tell exactly where. Dogged determination kept the teams searching in Lord’s Rake, up Black Crag and in Red Gill. Finally a clear line of sight could be made and fortunately the group was thankfully found to be dogfast rather than cragfast, on steep ground but manageable with care. Dexter, the 40kg Doberman/Belgian Malinois cross had decided not to move any further on nightfall, despite much encouragement. The walkers were uninjured, cold, and had not wanted to leave their dog on the fell. They were equipped well enough to spend an unplanned night on the fell, and we found that Dexter was trained to bark and howl, thus initially attracting our attention. Other rescuers harnessed the energy to make the hard pull up to their location but no amount of encouragement could make Dexter move downhill. The agreed course of action was to wait for daylight and hope that he regained his confidence to move downhill with better visibility. As such, bivvy shelters were deployed for all, and a long paws ensued. After a woof night, as dawn broke, further attempts were made but Dexter stood fast. As hope was fading a last ditch attempt was made with a 50m rope lead and he was gently encouraged downhill . Thankfully once he started moving there were no further problems and a brisk, boisterous and friendly walk with Dexter was then made back to Brackenclose. The team wearily were recalled to base and the vehicles were reset. A friendly team member had kindly played fetch with breakfast butties from the local shop. After gratefully consuming these, the team returned home for a lie down.

The mobile signal was patchy but a location was obtained at Mickledore near the stretcher box. Knowing that the stretcher box has directions on the outside and is a source of shelter with insulating materials stored inside, the decision from the Team Leader and the police was to wait until dawn for a re-evaluation and possible team deployment. Contact was able to be made at first light. The two walkers had indeed sheltered inside the stretcher box, but there was also a report of a leg injury with one of them. As such a team callout was made and again Duddon and Furness MRT supported with additional fell going members for a potentially long stretcher carry. Once on scene, re-warming with additional clothing and food and drink was provided, alongside a medical assessment and some pain relief. This enabled the walker to mobilise sufficiently to walk off the fell under his own steam after some additional rope protection was provided down Mickledore gully for extra confidence and security. The rest of the walk off proceeded well and the walkers were escorted safely down to the valley. Both teams then returned to Wasdale base for some hot refreshments and pizza. Thanks once more to Duddon and Furness MRT. We also hope the walkers are none the worse for their unplanned night on the fell.

Multiple 999 calls had been made about shouts and whistles on the flanks of Scafell, heard by walkers on the tourist path of Scafell Pike. Helimed support was requested and they agreed to mobilise quickly to help establish exact location, and directly support if possible. Unfortunately despite several attempts they were thwarted due to unfavourable winds and they were unable to get close enough to make visual contact with the casualty. The landed in the valley, subsequently standing by for a long time in case advanced medical support was required. Coastguard helicopter support was also agreed and deployed from Prestwick with Rescue 199. With different aircraft capability and technology on board they were able to get a visual and confirm exact location. Unfortunately they were also unable to directly help and provide a winch rescue due to the proximity of the crag face. The Rescue 199 crew then helped hugely by lifting three sets of team members to the closest location possible, from which they walked uphill to Red Gill. On arrival the walker was unfortunately located in the gully itself, very close to a 10m drop. As such, a technical rope rescue was required. The casualty was unable to move by himself, but was able to talk and had managed to wrap a survival blanket around him. As a technical and labour intensive rescue was now likely, additional team members from our friends at Duddon and Furness MRT was again requested. R199 again obliged and lifted four of their team members and additional rope and medical supplies from Devoke Water en-route to Wasdale. Other DFMRT members followed in team vehicles. Once Wasdale team members had secured sufficient rope protection in a difficult environment for firm â€˜anchorsâ€™, they were able to descend to the casualty and make an assessment. Despite taking two significant tumble falls there fortunately was no evidence of any significant life threatening injuries. It was agreed that the walker would attempt to move himself slowly from the gully with support from the rope system and team members. This was able to be done and once off the more technical ground, a more straightforward descent with support was made to get to a location that was suitable for a helicopter winch. Rescue 199 again returned to the scene, winched the walker and transported to hospital for full assessment and treatment. This left the teams to de-rig and walk back down to the valley and then to respective bases. We would like to offer our huge thanks to all the teams involved, and especially the Rescue 199 crew who did everything they possibly could to speed up the effort to locate, enable access and then transport the walker to a hospital setting.

Both teams met at Gavel Neese and made their way up to the likely access point.
As any rope access into Piers Gill is inherently hazardous, helicopter support was also requested via a Coastguard helicopter with winching capability. Rescue 199 from Prestwick duly attended but unfortunately were not able to effect the rescue via winch due to the weather conditions requiring high power and the resulting significant downdraft creating a real risk to the walkers below.

Mobile signal was very borderline and all attempts of further conversation proved impossible. However, fortunately they were able to give Cumbria Police their â€˜Lat/Longâ€™ coordinates that they had obtained from a mobile phone. It was decided to send two small groups in case they were still moving. It was also not known whether they were adequately equipped for the heavy rain forecasted during the night. Unfortunately for us, this location is one of the most remote on our â€˜patchâ€™ (and possibly the whole of the Lake District) so this required long walks in by small groups from both Wasdale and Eskdale. Shortly after setting off, the Eskdale team came across another group of misplaced walkers, unfortunately they were not the group they were looking for. They were 3-peakers who were now likely going to miss their goal with a long walk out to the wrong valley. Eventually the Wasdale group found the casualty party of walkers (as it turned out, three!) in roughly the location expected. The walkers were then escorted back to Wasdale and then to base for the subsequent long and expensive taxi journey. Both parties were not adequately equipped in terms of navigation equipment or skills. Misty conditions do make navigation challenging, and especially so, high on the Scafell Massif. Fortunately on this occasion the only consequences were time, effort, discomfort, missed objectives, cost for taxis, and some damaged pride. However, the risks to safety are very real, both in terms of hypothermia (yes, even in August if there is poor weather) and crag fast or fall risk if walkers stray into the wrong areas.

As he was intending to sleep on the fell overnight he had a sleeping bag which he was asked to get into whilst awaiting help. Due to slightly low numbers, and the potential for a long and difficult stretcher carry, Keswick MRT were asked to help. Once on scene, extra shelter, insulation, and food and drink was provided, alongside a medical assessment and some pain relief. Following this, the walker was able to walk with some assistance part of the way, however, later a stretcher was required. It was decided that the route down to Seathwaite was the better option from Sty Head, so after some help over the tricky ground initially, the teams went their separate ways and the walker was carried by the Keswick team to an awaiting ambulance for further assessment.

The Team Leader alerted Keswick MRT, RAF Leeming MRS, Lake District Mountain Rescue Search Dogs and also the Coastguard helicopter for possible deployment.

Once team members were on scene, a full medical assessment was made, and it was decided that due to the mechanism of injury (a tumble fall of 20m), and a long and difficult stretcher carry out to a road head, helicopter assistance was required. Helimed 58 duly responded and was able to land on flat ground near Pulpit Rock. Attempts to get closer were thwarted by gusty winds. As such, an energy sapping uphill carry was still required, with helicopter medics in attendance, after which the walker was flown to hospital for further assessment and treatment.

 A call was received from Cumbria Police about two walkers who found themselves on steep ground on Scafell and felt it was unsafe to continue in any direction. Initial information was lacking in much detail due to the poor signal and it was not possible to make further contact. However a location was fortunately obtained from the initial police call. A full callout was made to investigate and assist the walkers back to safety. However, as the team were mobilising, a further call was received from the police to say that the walkers had been in touch again. They had been helped by a passing climber and they were now back on safe ground.

A late evening call came on Wednesday night when Cumbria Police alerted us to a lone walker who was cragfast. This was initially reported to be on Broad Stand, but on checking the coordinates from the police call, was confirmed to be slightly further South to our â€˜normalâ€™ crag job on the East Buttress of Scafell.


Care was taken to understand the exact nature of his predicament as deploying rescue teams immediately in the dark in a crag environment without sleep carries its own risks. On balance, it was decided to deploy as he was on a small ledge with a significant drop beneath, safe in the short term but not to leave for many more hours.


Coastguard helicopter support was requested quickly, as a â€˜pick offâ€™ winch by them might have been possible. However cloud had descended in the area and, after several attempts, Rescue 199 from Prestwick returned home for fuel, and the teams made their way up the hill for a rope rescue. Extra support was then requested and given by Duddon and Furness MRT.


Having ascended Scafell, it took some time for the Wasdale team to establish the best and safest access route, from close to the summit. This involved a diagonal lower of the rescuer. This also meant the casualty was less at risk from rockfall from the rescuer and belay party. Rope protection was used to descend to the point where they could establish belay anchors for the lower.


However, at about 3am the clouds lifted sufficiently to attempt another helicopter rescue, and this time Rescue 936 from Caernarfon lifted to support. However, when it arrived, the winch rescue was also assessed to be very risky, so plan A became the rope rescue. The Wasdale team was now in position and a rescuer descended to the cragfast person. The team members below at Mickledore needed to guide the rescuer to the correct location as this was not visible from above. Once on the scene the walker was successfully secured with a harness and attached to the rope for a protected down-climb to safety below. Most of the team members then followed and abseiled down with the excess equipment.


The teams and walker were very grateful for the support from the crew of R936 who gave lifts back down to the valley after a long night. The remaining two (unlucky!) Wasdale team members de-rigged and descended by foot back to the valley, as again the helicopter was low on fuel and had to depart. Hearty breakfasts back at base for all were gratefully received after an â€˜all-nighterâ€™ and the vehicles were then restocked for the next callout.


Many thanks to the crew of Rescue 199 and 936 and Duddon and Furness MRT once again. Weâ€™re also sorry if local residents were disturbed by the helicopter activity. A tricky job with great teamwork, and an excellent outcome.

He reluctantly conceded to this and a routine carry was undertaken off the fell to Brackenclose.

The standard team response was initiated, involving a foot party and a boat party to provide the easiest and quickest rescue, with a further small â€˜receivingâ€™ team based on the road side of the lake.

The Helimed crew arrived first and assessed and treated the walker whilst the MR team members ascended as swiftly as possible in the heat. Once stabilised, the quickest evacuation route for the walker involved an uphill stretcher carry, and thanks to some skilful flying to relocate the helicopter by the H58 pilot the effort was significantly reduced. After the short carry the walker was transferred to the aircraft and then flown to hospital to continue his treatment.

The team received a call yesterday evening from Cumbria Police about a lone walker who was tired and worried about being able to safely return to Seathwaite in the dark. She had no torch, was inexperienced on the high fells and had low battery life on her mobile phone. She had set off in the afternoon at 2.30pm. As she was not lost and on a path with walkers still on the fell, she was advised to take the shorter route down to Wasdale with others from other groups. However, contact was lost and she did not confirm she was safely back in a valley overnight, so a search was initiated by both Keswick MRT and Wasdale in the morning. Search dogs were also called out. Fortunately shortly after the callout it was confirmed that she had made it safely down, after spending the night somewhere around Middleboot Knotts. Itâ€™s a good reminder that although the nights are short at this time of the year, adequate equipment is still needed if there are delays or things go wrong. Also that a walk up Scafell Pike can take many hours depending on starting point and route, conditions, experience and fitness so give yourself plenty of time. We wish the walker well after her adventure. Please share freely to raise awareness, but please refrain from criticism, as this could indirectly prevent others from asking for help from us in the future.

He managed to speak to one of the runners, who agreed to lead the party to Broad Crag Col and point them in the direction of Lingmell Col and the path back to Wasdale Head. As one of the four was having a panic attack and others were struggling with aching limbs and all lacked confidence in finding the route down, it was decided to do a limited callout for a small party to meet the group and walk them down. Further use of Phonefind traced their progress to Broad Crag Col where they had been left by the runners, but more calls from the team leader were needed to give them the confidence to begin and then continue their descent. Although the team leader was able to speak to the party at several points on the descent, Phonefind was no longer working from Broad Crag Col  until another of the parties phones was used putting them on the main path below Lingmell Col.

While the team leader was trying to contact them, a further call came in from NWAS to say there was a report of a missing walker with possible injuries on the Corridor Route of Scafell Pike, “phonefind” put them at the Greta Gill crossing on the Corridor Route. Despite extensive questioning of the group whose friend was missing, there was confusion over their location as they described descending Mickledore and being in Hollow Stones, then talked about intending to do a scramble on the way down. However, the description of their location tallied with the phonefind, although this is not infallible. The friend had gone ahead around “a blind corner”, they had lost sight of him and could not make contact. Given that this is an accident black spot, it was felt that there was a high probability that the friend had fallen into Greta Gill and sustained serious, maybe fatal injuries. The team were called out, as were Duddon and Furness team – again – as a stretcher carry from this spot is very difficult. A coastguard helicopter with winching capability was also requested, but as ever, the team still has to mobilise as there are no guarantees that the helicopter will not be called away to another incident. This in fact happened whilst they were en route from Prestwick, and another helicopter from Caernoarfon was tasked to assist us. The team met 2 walkers at Burnthwaite, heading for Brackenclose, who described coming down from Hollow Stones, and believing that one of the party they had met on the hill had a leg injury. The team made their way up towards the Corridor Route from Gavel Neese, searching as they went and were joined by the helicopter who started their search of the area. A second Duddon and Furness Team vehicle went to Brackenclose to talk to these two walkers. Eventually it transpired that one of the walkers that the team had met at Burnthwaite was the missing person, who had crossed the “bad step” but could not get back again, so continued and descended to Wasdale via Spouthead Gill. He was uninjured. We don’t know if he attempted to let his friends know he was OK and walking off. The remaining walkers were escorted off the hill via Lingmell Nose, where one of them twisted an ankle, but managed to walk down with difficulty. All teams were then stood down.

Having team members with their own pampered pooches at home and also our very own much adored search dog Jess, we recognise the distress that both an animal can feel and also that of their owners.  Therefore, last night when Cumbria Police contacted us about a St. Bernard dog (Daisy) who had collapsed whilst descending from the summit of Scafell Pike and therefore unable to carry on; our members didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to think twice about mobilising and deploying to help retrieve Daisy off EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highest.  Displaying signs of pain in her rear legs and refusing to move, DaisyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s owners were able to keep her well hydrated and fed until team members were able to get on scene with a stretcher to help get them moving again quickly as the weather was due to deteriorate later that evening. In advance of getting on location advice had been sought from several local vets regarding pain relief, possible issues specific to that breed of dog and how best to handle them in such stressful situations.  On reaching their location, team members carefully introduced themselves to Daisy so as not to cause any additional distress, and with the help of a treat or two members were able to assess her condition and administer analgesia for the pain.  A few different tactics needed to be tried until both Daisy and her stretcher bearers were all satisfied and progress down-hill could be made. It had become quickly apparent that DaisyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cooperation was going to be essential if we were to make progress as Daisy made sure we knew that if she didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to do something, she wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t going to do it. However, after a little persuasion and a bit of arranging the stretcher to become dog friendly and of course plenty more treats, the 55kg Daisy very quickly settled down with her chin resting on the head guard, having realised that we were trying to help her. From there on, apart from the odd little adjustment, the evacuation was found to be not that much different to a normal adult evacuation which is of course is the bread and butter of our team, which we have done hundreds of times before.  The adorable Daisy who unfortunately had a hard start in life until she was Ã¢â‚¬Å“rescuedÃ¢â‚¬Â by her current owners a few months ago, has since been reported to have had a good nightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sleep, snoring a little louder than normal, but back to her usual high spirits this morning. She apparently feels a bit guilty and slightly embarrassed about letting down the image of her cousins bouncing across the Alpine snows with barrels of brandy around their necks. Wasdale Mountain Rescue Team would like to thank both West Lakeland Veterinary Group and Galemire Veterinary Hospital who got in touch and gave invaluable advice and support. Finally, a massive whole 55kg thank you to Daisy the St Bernard who was so well behaved throughout the whole rescue, the perfect casualty you could say.

During the county wide flooding in early December the west of the county was fortunately less badly affected and the Wasdale team took on the role of helping to coordinate the response elsewhere as well as providing a Ã¢â‚¬ËœType CÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ team of swiftwater rescue technicians. This article presents an overview of the events between Sat 5th Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sun 7th December. Early on Saturday morning it was apparent that it had rained hard for a long time and was likely to do so for a lot longer. The morning teleconferences started to conclude that a major flood incident was likely and soon tasks were coming in, particularly around Keswick and Kendal. Around lunchtime Keswick were dealing with a large number of jobs and support was sent from Cockermouth, Wasdale and Duddon teams. Kendal also started to get busy and a second Duddon team went over to support there. Langdale Ã¢â‚¬â€œAmbleside were tasked to help rescue people from a bus trapped by landslides on the A591. At this point it started to become apparent that the incident would go on for a long time in many different places and if the MR effort was to keep pace further support was needed. Calls went out to the other regions to ask what help they might be able to offer ? Later on Saturday evening Cockermouth started to flood as well and the main street became a river once again. There was now activity in every MR base in Cumbria, except for Patterdale, which was flooded. Despite the west of Cumbria being relatively unaffected there was a 6 strong team in the Wasdale base helping to keep an overview of events elsewhere. Operations continued through the night around the county. On Sunday the focus started to shift to Carlisle. The out of county teams were important to the MR effort in Carlisle as many of the local teams were busy in their own areas. During the Sunday groups from the Peak District, Calder Valley, Ogwen / North Wales, Swaledale, Upper Wharfdale, Kirkby Stephen, Coniston, Penrith and Wasdale teams were all deployed in Carlisle. Bowland Pennine and CRO also supported in the south of the county. Away from Carlisle operations were still ongoing in Cockermouth and Kendal and new fronts started to open up. Penrith had a number of incidents in Eamont Bridge. Kirkby Stephen were called to help with evacuations in Appleby. Patterdale, now displaced from their base, supported this effort and also helped with the rescue of an Ullswater steamer that broke free from its moorings. Duddon team helped to move Kidney Dialysis patients in the south of the county. Operations continued through Sunday night but by now it was apparent that the pace had to slow, not just because the swiftwater teams were tired but it was also becoming difficult to man the various supporting roles in the bases. Into Monday and there was still flooding in Carlisle and the east of the county but the water was starting to go down slowly elsewhere. The effort continued in Carlisle with mainly local teams from Duddon, Penrith and Wasdale along with the second team to come up from Ogwen. It was known earlier in the weekend that things were difficult in Patterdale but the picture that started to emerge through the day was a community without power, water or telephone links and had been cut off for 2 days due to collapse of Pooley Bridge. The Patterdale team started to get back into the village and with their limited communications provide a picture of the conditions down the valley. By the evening the flood waters had receded in most places and it was only in Patterdale that MR operations continued. ", Incident started at 07:00.

LEARNING – Both of these incident we have dealt with this evening have been a direct result of groups becoming separated whilst on the hill for varying reasons. It is essential that if you are in a group that you stay together unless the situation dictates that someone must get help. Especially if your equipment is spread across the group. Further to this, the current weather forecast is predicated to get rather cold over the weekend with snow on the hills, winter is still in mountains and you should go prepared with a torch, plenty of warm and waterproof clothing and a map / compass.
Please take note of the learning above and understand if you are going to comment on the above that you do not have the whole picture of the groups situation at the time of these events. WMRT.
