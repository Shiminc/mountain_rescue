Two climbers were ascending a crag on Sca Fell, when the lead climber took a large fall. He was seriously injured, unable to communicate and ended the fall suspended on the rope below the second climber. Fortunately, the second climber was uninjured and still secure on the crag, but urgently needed assistance.\nThe team was very quickly called out and help was requested from a Coastguard helicopter. Helimed 58 also responded quickly. As the team assembled at Brackenclose and prepared the large inventory of rope rescue, medical and other equipment required for a hugely challenging technical rescue, Rescue 199 arrived overhead. With the backup plan to uplift team members high on Sca Fell, saving significant time and effort for team members to get close to the scene, the crew of Rescue 199 took a close look at whether a winch rescue was possible. After some time carefully assessing the risks to all involved, an attempt to winch was made. We don\u2019t normally use superlatives, but with some truly amazing and heroic flying skills and teamwork, they managed to both access and then safely winch the climber directly into the helicopter from his suspended position on the end of the rope. A transfer to Helimed 58 was then completed to allow advanced medical care to be given, before then flying to a suitable hospital.\nWith the most urgent rescue completed by the helicopter crews, the rescue of the second climber still remained on what is one of the most inaccessible points of the Wasdale MR area. With the offer of further uplift assistance from Rescue 199 still a possibility (but not a guarantee), some members of the team set off on foot with heavy loads to the top of Sca Fell. However, after a refuel of the helicopter, the remaining ten team members were very grateful to get the lift up, comfortably overtaking the hill party. At this point, the technical rope rescue began, with several hundred metres of rope and countless other pieces of equipment assuring the safety of both team members and the climber. After some time, in very cold and windy conditions at height, the first rescuer was able to be lowered to the climber. She was able to very bravely and ably assist the rescue, doing most of the work herself to climb and scramble back to safe ground.\nAfter de-rigging, the long walk down to Brackenclose was completed safely and the climber re-united with awaiting family members. The team travelled back to base and spent considerable time checking equipment for damage and resetting the vehicles, before a debrief and finally being stood down to return home.\nOur thanks to both helicopter crews, and especially the crew of Rescue 199, whose actions brought the time down for the injured climber getting to definitive medical care by many hours.\nWe wish both climbers well and offer our very best wishes that the injured climber recovers fully from his injuries.

The group of two were reporting themselves lost and thoroughly soaked, their waterproofs having succumbed to the heavy and prolonged rain. In addition, the other walker could now not be contacted and they were concerned for his safety. The Team Leader called the team out after considering the risks for all, also requesting support from Duddon and Furness MRT and Lake District Mountain Rescue Search Dogs. This gave sufficient resource for a search, especially for the uncontactable lone walker.

It was considered too risky to attempt a \u2018talk-off\u2019 due to poor communications and their likely location. On arrival at Brackenclose there was some good news as the lone walker was located in the car park. He was taken care of and the extra resources of search dogs and Duddon and Furness MRT were able to be stood down. Team members made their way to Piers Gill and were able to locate the group of two in the expected place. They then safely negotiated challenging weather conditions and rising water levels on the descent to the valley. Again there are some lessons to learn and share, a few in particular to note here: Weather warnings will be more severe on the mountains. Team members reported some gusts risking blowing them off their feet. The mountain will be there another day. Navigation is always much more challenging in poor weather. Stick together as a group.

There was also a separate call for a lone walker that was directed initially to Keswick MRT with an initial location in their area. A full callout was made in case a stretcher carry became needed, and team members made their way to the location. Once on scene, after some additional clothing, calories and reassurance, a slow walk-off proved possible with some direct assistance from team members. It was established on the descent that the group of five walkers accounted for both alerts as the lone walker had met up with the group of four. The descent to Wasdale valley was completed without incident, and the group of five taken back to base for a debrief and to pick up a taxi.
