However, they were unable to access the walker safely. As the exact location became clearer a Coastguard helicopter with winching capability was requested and Rescue 936 from Caernarfon was dispatched. With numbers a little low due to many team members unavailable at an annual team training event, and with the likelihood of a difficult medical situation alongside a technical rope rescue, additional support from Duddon and Furness MRT was also requested. Unfortunately weather conditions did not allow a direct winch by Rescue 936, so they kindly offered to provide multiple lifts of team members and heavy crag rescue equipment as high as possible. Once on scene a medical assessment was made and strong pain relief given to make the walker more comfortable. He was then packaged carefully into a vacuum mattress (full body splint) and the team stretcher. With conditions still preventing a helicopter winch, the evacuation had to be achieved by a stretcher lower of 150m down a steep gully using approximately 400m metres of rope. Once safely back down to relatively level ground at Hollow Stones, Rescue 936 once again attempted to evacuate, only to be thwarted by the descending cloud base and arriving rain. A stretcher carry was made safely down to Brackenclose, and the walker finally transferred into the care of a NWAS land ambulance crew for onward assessment and treatment at hospital.

He was seriously injured, unable to communicate and ended the fall suspended on the rope below the second climber. Fortunately, the second climber was uninjured and still secure on the crag, but urgently needed assistance.\nThe team was very quickly called out and help was requested from a Coastguard helicopter. Helimed 58 also responded quickly. As the team assembled at Brackenclose and prepared the large inventory of rope rescue, medical and other equipment required for a hugely challenging technical rescue, Rescue 199 arrived overhead. With the backup plan to uplift team members high on Sca Fell, saving significant time and effort for team members to get close to the scene, the crew of Rescue 199 took a close look at whether a winch rescue was possible. After some time carefully assessing the risks to all involved, an attempt to winch was made. We don\u2019t normally use superlatives, but with some truly amazing and heroic flying skills and teamwork, they managed to both access and then safely winch the climber directly into the helicopter from his suspended position on the end of the rope. A transfer to Helimed 58 was then completed to allow advanced medical care to be given, before then flying to a suitable hospital.\nWith the most urgent rescue completed by the helicopter crews, the rescue of the second climber still remained on what is one of the most inaccessible points of the Wasdale MR area. With the offer of further uplift assistance from Rescue 199 still a possibility (but not a guarantee), some members of the team set off on foot with heavy loads to the top of Sca Fell. However, after a refuel of the helicopter, the remaining ten team members were very grateful to get the lift up, comfortably overtaking the hill party. At this point, the technical rope rescue began, with several hundred metres of rope and countless other pieces of equipment assuring the safety of both team members and the climber. After some time, in very cold and windy conditions at height, the first rescuer was able to be lowered to the climber. She was able to very bravely and ably assist the rescue, doing most of the work herself to climb and scramble back to safe ground.\nAfter de-rigging, the long walk down to Brackenclose was completed safely and the climber re-united with awaiting family members. The team travelled back to base and spent considerable time checking equipment for damage and resetting the vehicles, before a debrief and finally being stood down to return home.\nOur thanks to both helicopter crews, and especially the crew of Rescue 199, whose actions brought the time down for the injured climber getting to definitive medical care by many hours.\nWe wish both climbers well and offer our very best wishes that the injured climber recovers fully from his injuries.

The group of two were reporting themselves lost and thoroughly soaked, their waterproofs having succumbed to the heavy and prolonged rain. In addition, the other walker could now not be contacted and they were concerned for his safety. The Team Leader called the team out after considering the risks for all, also requesting support from Duddon and Furness MRT and Lake District Mountain Rescue Search Dogs. This gave sufficient resource for a search, especially for the uncontactable lone walker. From a conversation with the party of two, it was deemed most likely that they were at the head of Piers Gill and so teams headed up the valley to begin the ascent. It was considered too risky to attempt a \u2018talk-off\u2019 due to poor communications and their likely location. On arrival at Brackenclose there was some good news as the lone walker was located in the car park. He was taken care of and the extra resources of search dogs and Duddon and Furness MRT were able to be stood down. Team members made their way to Piers Gill and were able to locate the group of two in the expected place. They then safely negotiated challenging weather conditions and rising water levels on the descent to the valley. Again there are some lessons to learn and share, a few in particular to note here: Weather warnings will be more severe on the mountains. Team members reported some gusts risking blowing them off their feet. The mountain will be there another day. Navigation is always much more challenging in poor weather. Stick together as a group. Again it is much easier to lose track of people in poor conditions. Thankfully all off the hill safe and well.

There was also a separate call for a lone walker that was directed initially to Keswick MRT with an initial location in their area. A full callout was made in case a stretcher carry became needed, and team members made their way to the location. Once on scene, after some additional clothing, calories and reassurance, a slow walk-off proved possible with some direct assistance from team members. It was established on the descent that the group of five walkers accounted for both alerts as the lone walker had met up with the group of four. The descent to Wasdale valley was completed without incident, and the group of five taken back to base for a debrief and to pick up a taxi. However, a taxi proved impossible to source on this occasion at 4am and so two team members unselfishly stayed with the group at base until one became available at 8am.

A Father was reporting his son overdue from a walk up Scafell Pike. He had reached the summit successfully at 4pm, however no contact had been possible since. As it was not known which route had been taken, a search of all of the normal car parks was undertaken, with his car discovered at Seathwaite by Keswick MRT. Due to the winter conditions including heavy snowfall at height, lone walker and his inexperience, a full callout was made for a search. Support from Keswick MRT, Duddon and Furness MRT, RAF Leeming, RAF Valley and Coastguard helicopter was requested and received quickly. As teams started their allocated search routes, a further request was made for additional resources from other Lakes teams in the morning for contingency planning. Unfortunately a key search asset Coastguard helicopter Rescue 199 was unable to complete its requested search area of Piers Gill due to low cloud. As such, the Team Leader diverted two team members onto this route. Weather conditions of heavy snow and 6 to 12 inches of lying snow at height made search conditions difficult and hazardous, with some parties aborting search routes at higher elevations. At about 2am, shouts from rescuers were rewarded with a faint call back followed by a whistle. Unfortunately it was the party tasked with Piers Gill, with the walker\u2019s location at the bottom of the gill soon confirmed by searchlight and thermal imaging scope. He confirmed that he had broken his leg and couldn\u2019t move. His two dogs were located above a waterfall pitch from him, but both seemed fit and well (see part 2). With a technical rope rescue (likely) or helicopter winch (unlikely due to the location and conditions) now the two options, the Team Leader coordinated resources to attempt both. Rescue 936 from Caernarfon this time was tasked to help. Two team members from another search route returned to the team vehicles at Brackenclose to ready medical, stretcher and crag rescue equipment. Eight loads of equipment were required, with only two team members, so Rescue 936 agreed to uplift the rescuers and equipment as close as possible. The RAF MR teams were closest to the scene so were redirected, with a total of 13 rescuers. With the weather improving and cloud base lifting, Rescue 936 attempted to directly access the walker, but this was not possible. Then, having found a landing site at Middleboot Knotts, they returned to Brackenclose to pickup the two team members and equipment. The RAF teams collected the extra equipment from the landing site and returned to scene. Rescue 936 left the area to refuel. \nA team casualty carer was then lowered via a side gully into the bottom of the gill, with further rescuers and equipment following. It was quickly established that the walker had suffered serious injuries and was very cold, but thankfully he had managed to find a small shelf to keep himself mostly out of the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwater. Medical assessment and treatment was given and cold wet clothing exchanged for dry in a bivvy shelter. As quickly as possible in very challenging conditions a stretcher, casualty bag, heat blankets, vacuum mattress and dual rope system was also established, and then the walker was packaged securely. The haul out of the gill was completed to the awaiting team members.\n Rescue 936 then returned to scene and winched the casualty, before transferring swiftly to hospital for further assessment and treatment. After the remaining team members were retrieved from the gill, equipment was packed up and the teams walked wearily back to Brackenclose. Once back at base at about noon all team members enjoyed much needed food and refreshments kindly prepared by other members. All in all, a very challenging search and rescue in winter conditions. Once more, great teamwork and support from all teams. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d particularly like to thank the visiting RAF teams and Rescue 936 for their help on scene. We wish the walker all the best and hope he recovers quickly and fully from his injuries. \nAll that remained was to rescue the walker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two dogs.

A lone male walker was reported overdue by a friend, having declared an intent to climb Scafell. He had left home early the previous morning, likely setting off on the fell at about 7:30am. The police had checked car parks and located his car at Brackenclose. Very limited additional information was known, other than he had intended to return the same day before the weather deteriorated (early afternoon). With team members recovering from the previous callout, coupled with the prospect of a major search on both Scafell and Scafell Pike, (walkers often talk about Scafell but really mean Scafell Pike) the Team Leader escalated the callout to regional level, requesting support from all other Lake District teams. The poor weather of the previous day made the search urgent due to risk of hypothermia. Visibility was still poor and the temperature was forecasted to drop further through the day. An initial Wasdale party set off at 04:42, and then other teams were tasked as they arrived at base, or remotely if that saved time. Search dogs and coastguard helicopter support was also received. As the digital map began to fill with many traces of individual rescuers, a shout was heard by the Cockermouth MRT team from the bottom of Piers Gill. The team were able to access the location with a rope system. Unfortunately the walker had suffered injuries to both ankles, amongst other injuries, and as such medical treatment and evacuation by stretcher was required. He had been in the gill injured for about 24 hours by this point having mis-navigated on his descent from the summit. Other teams on the hill then migrated to the evacuation point with further medical equipment. Specialist rope rescue equipment, stretcher, and further casualty packaging was flown from the valley with additional team members by Coastguard helicopter Rescue 199. Medical assessment and treatment was given in the gill before a technical rescue was then undertaken, led by the Cockermouth team and with assistance from all the other teams present. Having done the hard bit, the normally straightforward part of either a stretcher carry or helicopter transport from the scene proved difficult. With weather conditions thwarting a helicopter extraction, and steep ground below preventing a descent by stretcher, the safest and quickest option was an uphill carry to Lingmell Col. After an energy sapping journey, also helped by a passing Assynt MRT team member, the walker was transferred into the care of the awaiting Helimed 58 crew. He was then flown to hospital for further treatment. We wish the walker a quick recovery from his injuries. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to offer huge thanks to all supporting teams and agencies, including offers received later in the morning and not required.

They had split up close to the summit, with the male walker ascending the final stretch in the mist, intending to return within a short time. When the male walker failed to return, and after a phone call saying that he had lost the path and was scrambling down on steep ground the informant was increasingly concerned when no further contact was possible. The Team Leader made a full callout and also asked a team member in the valley to travel direct to help the informant off the hill and obtain further information. At this point she had almost made it back to Brackenclose. With lots of uncertainty, and the possibility of a search over a large area, Duddon and Furness MRT was asked to search the paths in Eskdale. Additionally two search dogs were given taskings. With 27 pairs of boots (and eight paws) on the ground in both valleys, the teams made their way uphill. After a couple of false alarms, a Wasdale hill party heard shouts from Piers Gill. On further careful investigation over the edge, a light was seen and soon it was confirmed that the walker was in a precarious position at the bottom of the gill. Fortunately he was able to stand and shout back to team members. All Wasdale parties converged and proceeded to set up rope access to enable team members to safely descend. Once on scene the walker was confirmed to have taken a few tumbles, and was soaking wet, but after some warming, food and extra clothing he was able to manage an assisted climb out of the gill. Once back on safe ground, he was further assessed and debriefed. He had suffered many abrasions from scrambling, slipping and sliding down treacherous ground on the descent in the gill. Due to this it was decided to take the longer but safer route back up to Lingmell Col before descending finally to Brackenclose. An ambulance was also requested as a precaution to further assess the walker. At Brackenclose, the two walkers were finally reunited, before being taken to hospital for a full assessment. The teams returned to their respective bases to reset the vehicles in readiness for the next callout. This was a great outcome given the location.

Cumbria Police alerted us to a report from a concerned family member. A group of two male walkers, plus a dog  (Dexter) had failed to make contact from an intended walk up Scafell Pike and were overdue. Due to the weather conditions, and real potential for hypothermia, a full callout was made and additional support gained from Duddon and Furness MRT and the Lake District search dogs. No contact was able to be made by mobile phone, so we did not have any real leads\u2122 as to which areas to search. Search teams were sent via the normal routes in Wasdale and Eskdale. The team sent to Sty Head were clearly barking up the wrong tree and found nothing. Other teams were poodling around for some time with nothing heard or seen. However, the search team in Hollow Stones heard a woof and a howl in response to their whistles, and so we finally had a Scooby Doo. The hunt was on. A light was seen high on the flanks of Scafell, but due to the mist it was very difficult to tell exactly where. Dogged determination kept the teams searching in Lord\u2019s Rake, up Black Crag and in Red Gill. Finally a clear line of sight could be made and fortunately the group was thankfully found to be dogfast rather than cragfast, on steep ground but manageable with care. Dexter, the 40kg Doberman/Belgian Malinois cross had decided not to move any further on nightfall, despite much encouragement. The walkers were uninjured, cold, and had not wanted to leave their dog on the fell. They were equipped well enough to spend an unplanned night on the fell, and we found that Dexter was trained to bark and howl, thus initially attracting our attention. Other rescuers harnessed the energy to make the hard pull up to their location but no amount of encouragement could make Dexter move downhill. The agreed course of action was to wait for daylight and hope that he regained his confidence to move downhill with better visibility. As such, bivvy shelters were deployed for all, and a long paws ensued. After a woof night, as dawn broke, further attempts were made but Dexter stood fast. As hope was fading a last ditch attempt was made with a 50m rope lead and he was gently encouraged downhill . Thankfully once he started moving there were no further problems and a brisk, boisterous and friendly walk with Dexter was then made back to Brackenclose. The team wearily were recalled to base and the vehicles were reset. A friendly team member had kindly played fetch with breakfast butties from the local shop. After gratefully consuming these, the team returned home for a lie down. We\u2019d like to thank Duddon and Furness MRT and Lake District Mountain Rescue Search Dogs for their rapid response to an initially urgent search. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  ", "rescue_info": " Incident started at 23:33 and ended at 10:29 making 10.9 hrs in total.

A full team callout was made and also extra support from Duddon and Furness MRT obtained.

Coastguard helicopter support was also agreed and deployed from Prestwick with Rescue 199. With different aircraft capability and technology on board they were able to get a visual and confirm exact location. Unfortunately they were also unable to directly help and provide a winch rescue due to the proximity of the crag face.

The casualty was unable to move by himself, but was able to talk and had managed to wrap a survival blanket around him. As a technical and labour intensive rescue was now likely, additional team members from our friends at Duddon and Furness MRT was again requested. R199 again obliged and lifted four of their team members and additional rope and medical supplies from Devoke Water en-route to Wasdale. Other DFMRT members followed in team vehicles.

However, fortunately they were able to give Cumbria Police their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLat/Long\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 coordinates that they had obtained from a mobile phone. It was decided to send two small groups in case they were still moving. It was also not known whether they were adequately equipped for the heavy rain forecasted during the night. Unfortunately for us, this location is one of the most remote on our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpatch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (and possibly the whole of the Lake District) so this required long walks in by small groups from both Wasdale and Eskdale. Shortly after setting off, the Eskdale team came across another group of misplaced walkers, unfortunately they were not the group they were looking for. They were 3-peakers who were now likely going to miss their goal with a long walk out to the wrong valley. Eventually the Wasdale group found the casualty party of walkers (as it turned out, three!) in roughly the location expected. The walkers were then escorted back to Wasdale and then to base for the subsequent long and expensive taxi journey. Both parties were not adequately equipped in terms of navigation equipment or skills. Misty conditions do make navigation challenging, and especially so, high on the Scafell Massif. Fortunately on this occasion the only consequences were time, effort, discomfort, missed objectives, cost for taxis, and some damaged pride. However, the risks to safety are very real, both in terms of hypothermia (yes, even in August if there is poor weather) and crag fast or fall risk if walkers stray into the wrong areas. Please share to raise awareness, as many walkers we encounter do still underestimate the difficulty of navigating in mist and/or darkness. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n ", "rescue_info": " Incident started at 20:37 and ended at 04:43 making 8.1 hrs in total.

They had also shown initiative to investigate the Keswick MRT Styhead stretcher box and obtain some emergency equipment from there to keep the walker and her daughter warm and sheltered. A full callout was already in progress from the previous alert so the team were diverted to make their way in increasingly wet, windy and cold conditions. Once on scene, team Casualty Carers assessed the walker. She had indeed obtained a painful injury to her lower leg which needed to be aligned and splinted. Strong analgesia was also given to make the long stretcher carry as comfortable as possible. After \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpackaging\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the team stretcher, the walker was carefully carried back to Wasdale Head. With impeccable timing, a land ambulance arrived at exactly the right moment and a handover was made, before the walker was transferred to hospital for further treatment. We wish her a swift recovery and hope to see her back on the fells soon.

They had tried to avoid a loose section on the lakeshore path, and ended up ascending to within 70m of the top of the hill. Team members tried to gain access from above but it was considered too dangerous due to the loose terrain, so they walked round and down to the lake shore and ascended from there. They were joined by Duddon and Furness MRT team members with more ropes and crag kit. Once on scene, the casualties were roped up and a little progress was made. However, once again, it was considered too risky because of the danger of falling rocks and boulders, so a helicopter with winching capability was requested. Fortuitously the cloud and rain which had been around for most of the day lifted enough to allow the helicopter to fly. The two walkers were winched, but the crew then stated it was too dangerous for the helicopter to lift team members due to the proximity of a buttress, loose ground and wind conditions. So they departed and team members retraced their steps down the hill.

While the team leader was trying to contact them, a further call came in from NWAS to say there was a report of a missing walker with possible injuries on the Corridor Route of Scafell Pike, \u201cphonefind\u201d put them at the Greta Gill crossing on the Corridor Route. Despite extensive questioning of the group whose friend was missing, there was confusion over their location as they described descending Mickledore and being in Hollow Stones, then talked about intending to do a scramble on the way down. However, the description of their location tallied with the phonefind, although this is not infallible. The friend had gone ahead around \u201ca blind corner\u201d, they had lost sight of him and could not make contact. Given that this is an accident black spot, it was felt that there was a high probability that the friend had fallen into Greta Gill and sustained serious, maybe fatal injuries. The team were called out, as were Duddon and Furness team \u2013 again \u2013 as a stretcher carry from this spot is very difficult. A coastguard helicopter with winching capability was also requested, but as ever, the team still has to mobilise as there are no guarantees that the helicopter will not be called away to another incident. This in fact happened whilst they were en route from Prestwick, and another helicopter from Caernoarfon was tasked to assist us. The team met 2 walkers at Burnthwaite, heading for Brackenclose, who described coming down from Hollow Stones, and believing that one of the party they had met on the hill had a leg injury. The team made their way up towards the Corridor Route from Gavel Neese, searching as they went and were joined by the helicopter who started their search of the area. A second Duddon and Furness Team vehicle went to Brackenclose to talk to these two walkers.

He was uninjured. We don\u2019t know if he attempted to let his friends know he was OK and walking off. The remaining walkers were escorted off the hill via Lingmell Nose, where one of them twisted an ankle, but managed to walk down with difficulty. All teams were then stood down.

Having team members with their own pampered pooches at home and also our very own much adored search dog Jess, we recognise the distress that both an animal can feel and also that of their owners.  Therefore, last night when Cumbria Police contacted us about a St. Bernard dog (Daisy) who had collapsed whilst descending from the summit of Scafell Pike and therefore unable to carry on; our members didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2t need to think twice about mobilising and deploying to help retrieve Daisy off England\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s highest.

In advance of getting on location advice had been sought from several local vets regarding pain relief, possible issues specific to that breed of dog and how best to handle them in such stressful situations.  On reaching their location, team members carefully introduced themselves to Daisy so as not to cause any additional distress, and with the help of a treat or two members were able to assess her condition and administer analgesia for the pain.  A few different tactics needed to be tried until both Daisy and her stretcher bearers were all satisfied and progress down-hill could be made. It had become quickly apparent that Daisy\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s cooperation was going to be essential if we were to make progress as Daisy made sure we knew that if she didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2t want to do something, she wasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2t going to do it. However, after a little persuasion and a bit of arranging the stretcher to become dog friendly and of course plenty more treats, the 55kg Daisy very quickly settled down with her chin resting on the head guard, having realised that we were trying to help her. From there on, apart from the odd little adjustment, the evacuation was found to be not that much different to a normal adult evacuation which is of course is the bread and butter of our team, which we have done hundreds of times before.  The adorable Daisy who unfortunately had a hard start in life until she was \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c5\u201crescued\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u009d by her current owners a few months ago, has since been reported to have had a good night\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s sleep, snoring a little louder than normal, but back to her usual high spirits this morning. She apparently feels a bit guilty and slightly embarrassed about letting down the image of her cousins bouncing across the Alpine snows with barrels of brandy around their necks.
